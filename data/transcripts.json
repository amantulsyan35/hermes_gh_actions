because</c> people that's really interesting because people that's really interesting because I<00:48:43.440><c> always</c><00:48:43.599><c> imagine</c><00:48:43.880><c> it</c><00:48:43.960><c> was</c><00:48:44.079><c> like</c><00:48:44.200><c> a</c><00:48:44.400><c> massive</c> I always imagine it was like a massive I always imagine it was like a massive team<00:48:45.480><c> but</c><00:48:45.680><c> 20</c><00:48:46.040><c> people</c><00:48:46.280><c> can</c><00:48:46.480><c> do</c><00:48:47.000><c> can</c><00:48:47.200><c> handle</c><00:48:47.440><c> a</c> team but 20 people can do can handle a team but 20 people can do can handle a lot<00:48:47.800><c> is</c><00:48:47.960><c> the</c><00:48:48.079><c> takeaway</c><00:48:48.559><c> there</c><00:48:49.559><c> what</c><00:48:49.680><c> was</c><00:48:49.839><c> the</c> lot is the takeaway there what was the lot is the takeaway there what was the scale<00:48:50.359><c> I</c><00:48:50.440><c> guess</c><00:48:50.599><c> where</c><00:48:50.799><c> you</c><00:48:50.960><c> stopped</c><00:48:51.319><c> manual</c> scale I guess where you stopped manual scale I guess where you stopped manual onboarding<00:48:52.119><c> just</c><00:48:52.240><c> for</c><00:48:52.440><c> folks</c><00:48:52.680><c> that</c><00:48:52.760><c> are</c><00:48:53.079><c> like</c> onboarding just for folks that are like onboarding just for folks that are like thinking<00:48:53.520><c> about</c><00:48:53.720><c> doing</c><00:48:53.960><c> this</c><00:48:54.079><c> and</c><00:48:54.240><c> then</c><00:48:54.359><c> went</c> thinking about doing this and then went thinking about doing this and then went to<00:48:54.720><c> stop</c><00:48:55.440><c> so</c><00:48:55.640><c> I</c><00:48:55.799><c> think</c><00:48:56.040><c> the</c><00:48:56.240><c> reason</c><00:48:56.480><c> to</c><00:48:56.880><c> stop</c><00:48:57.359><c> is</c> to stop so I think the reason to stop is to stop so I think the reason to stop is that<00:48:57.640><c> there</c><00:48:57.760><c> will</c><00:48:57.960><c> always</c><00:48:58.280><c> be</c><00:48:58.520><c> certain</c> that there will

that</c><00:06:28.639><c> CentOS</c><00:06:29.039><c> the</c><00:06:29.199><c> Freshmaker</c> always call that CentOS the Freshmaker always call that CentOS the Freshmaker And<00:06:30.160><c> so</c><00:06:30.319><c> it's</c><00:06:30.560><c> just</c><00:06:30.639><c> like</c><00:06:30.880><c> I'm</c><00:06:31.039><c> in</c><00:06:31.199><c> this</c><00:06:31.360><c> very</c> And so it's just like I'm in this very And so it's just like I'm in this very cold<00:06:32.319><c> That's</c><00:06:32.560><c> nice</c><00:06:32.960><c> Thank</c><00:06:33.199><c> you</c><00:06:34.000><c> I'm</c><00:06:34.160><c> in</c><00:06:34.400><c> like</c> cold That's nice Thank you I'm in like cold That's nice Thank you I'm in like this<00:06:34.720><c> cold</c><00:06:35.039><c>

this</c> Java and I still I have just such this Java and I still I have just such this memory<00:06:42.080><c> of</c><00:06:42.319><c> despair</c><00:06:43.319><c> because</c><00:06:44.319><c> I</c><00:06:44.720><c> love</c> memory of despair because I love memory of despair because I love programming<00:06:45.600><c> This</c><00:06:45.840><c> was</c><00:06:46.080><c> after</c><00:06:46.319><c> the</c><00:06:46.479><c> linked</c> programming This was after the linked programming This was after the linked list<00:06:47.120><c> and</c><00:06:47.520><c> I</c><00:06:48.000><c> cannot</c><00:06:48.800><c> figure</c><00:06:49.120><c> out</c><00:06:49.759><c> recursion</c> list and I cannot figure out recursion list and I cannot figure out recursion And<00:06:50.720><c> so</c><00:06:50.880><c> I</c><00:06:51.120><c> go</c><00:06:51.280><c> to</c><00:06:51.840><c> you</c><00:06:52.000><c> know</c><00:06:52.160><c> the</c><00:06:52.400><c>

and it's Dell and Dell<00:06:55.840><c> learn</c><00:06:56.080><c> Java</c><00:06:56.400><c> and</c><00:06:56.560><c> it</c><00:06:56.720><c> has</c><00:06:56.800><c> a</c><00:06:56.960><c>

of recursion We have to do it's the week of recursion We have to do a<00:07:40.960><c> lab</c><00:07:41.240><c> assignment</c><00:07:42.240><c> I'm</c><00:07:42.479><c> not</c><00:07:42.639><c>

being able to do it And I just remember being like<00:07:44.400><c> genuinely</c><00:07:45.039><c> worried</c><00:07:45.360><c> about</c><00:07:45.520><c> that</c><00:07:46.400><c> Uh</c><00:07:46.800><c> and</c> like genuinely worried about that Uh and like genuinely worried about that Uh and then<00:07:47.280><c> because</c><00:07:47.520><c> I</c><00:07:47.680><c> always</c><00:07:48.000><c> my</c><00:07:48.240><c> big</c><00:07:48.400><c> problem</c><00:07:48.479><c> was</c> then because I always my big problem was then because I always my big problem was is<00:07:48.880><c> like</c><00:07:49.120><c> okay</c><00:07:49.360><c> do</c><00:07:49.520><c> factorial</c><00:07:50.160><c> Why</c><00:07:50.319><c> not</c><00:07:50.479><c> just</c> is like okay do factorial Why not just is like okay do factorial Why not just use<00:07:50.720><c> a</c><00:07:50.880><c> for</c><00:07:51.160><c> loop</c><00:07:52.160><c> okay</c><00:07:52.400><c> what</c><00:07:52.639><c> about</c><00:07:52.880><c> Fibonacci</c> use a for loop okay what about Fibonacci use a for loop okay what about Fibonacci sequence<00:07:54.000><c> why</c><00:07:54.160><c> not</c><00:07:54.319><c> use</c><00:07:54.479><c> a</c><00:07:54.560><c> for</c><00:07:54.800><c> loop</c><00:07:55.280><c> like</c><00:07:55.440><c> I</c> sequence why not use a for loop like I sequence why not use a for loop like I don't<00:07:55.759><c> understand</c><00:07:56.160><c> what's</c><00:07:56.400><c> the</c><00:07:56.639><c> purpose</c><00:07:56.879><c> of</c> don't understand what's the purpose of don't understand what's the purpose of recursion<00:07:57.599><c> I</c><00:07:57.759><c> don't</c><00:07:57.919><c> understand</c><00:07:58.240><c> it</c><00:07:58.479><c> yet</c><00:07:58.800><c> It's</c> recursion I don't understand it yet It's recursion I don't understand it yet It's so<00:07:59.199><c> powerful</c><00:07:59.759><c> Why</c><00:08:00.160><c> it</c><00:08:00.319><c> looks</c><00:08:00.479><c> like</c><00:08:00.639><c> a</c><00:08:00.800><c> really</c> so powerful Why it looks like a really so powerful Why it looks like a really complicated<00:08:01.520><c> for</c><00:08:01.759><c> loop</c><00:08:02.240><c> And</c><00:08:02.400><c> so</c><00:08:02.560><c> I</c><00:08:02.720><c> just</c><00:08:02.960><c> could</c> complicated for loop And so I just could complicated for loop And so I just could not<00:08:03.440><c> understand</c><00:08:03.840><c> it</c><00:08:04.319><c> And</c><00:08:04.479><c> then</c><00:08:04.720><c> lab</c><00:08:05.120><c> came</c><00:08:05.280><c> that</c> not understand it And then lab came that not understand it And then lab came that day<00:08:06.240><c> and</c><00:08:06.560><c> it</c><00:08:06.919><c> was</c><00:08:07.919><c> I'm</c><00:08:08.080><c> going</c><00:08:08.160><c> to</c><00:08:08.319><c> give</c><00:08:08.400><c> you</c><00:08:08.639><c> a</c> day and it was I'm

Yeah I Thank you Dylan Moyward Okay Wow Yeah I did<00:13:09.920><c> not</c><00:13:10.079><c> expect</c><00:13:10.399><c> that</c><00:13:11.040><c> That</c><00:13:11.279><c> escalated</c> did not expect that That escalated did not expect that That escalated quickly<00:13:12.160><c> Anyway</c><00:13:12.560><c> what</c><00:13:12.639><c> do</c><00:13:12.800><c> you</c><00:13:13.040><c> identify</c><00:13:13.360><c> as</c> quickly Anyway what do you identify as quickly Anyway what do you identify as okay<00:13:14.160><c> So</c><00:13:14.959><c> first</c><00:13:15.200><c> you</c><00:13:15.600><c> let's</c><00:13:15.839><c> let's</c><00:13:16.079><c> do</c><00:13:16.240><c> the</c> okay So first you let's let's do the okay So first you let's let's do the previous<00:13:16.959><c> or</c><00:13:17.200><c> the</c><00:13:17.360><c> in</c><00:13:17.519><c> in</c><00:13:17.760><c> between</c><00:13:18.079><c> question</c> previous or the in in between question previous or the in in between question first<00:13:18.560><c> which</c><00:13:18.800><c> is</c><00:13:18.959><c> the</c><00:13:19.200><c> different</c><00:13:19.440><c> kind</c><00:13:19.600><c> of</c> first which is the different kind of first which is the different kind of archetypes<00:13:20.480><c> I</c><00:13:20.639><c> think</c><00:13:20.720><c> that's</c><00:13:20.959><c> a</c><00:13:21.120><c> really</c> archetypes I think that's a really archetypes I think that's a really interesting<00:13:21.839><c> kind</c><00:13:22.000><c> of</c><00:13:22.160><c> question</c><00:13:22.399><c> because</c><00:13:22.720><c> if</c> interesting kind of question because if interesting kind of question because if you<00:13:22.959><c> go</c><00:13:23.120><c> on</c><00:13:23.279><c> Twitter</c><00:13:23.839><c> or</c><00:13:24.079><c> you're</c><00:13:24.320><c> new</c><00:13:24.880><c> your</c> you go on Twitter or you're new your you go on Twitter or you're new your thoughts<00:13:25.440><c> are</c><00:13:25.680><c> probably</c><00:13:26.079><c> that</c><00:13:26.880><c> there</c><00:13:27.120><c> is</c><00:13:27.360><c>

there's</c><00:13:29.279><c> some</c> web programming and maybe there's some web programming and maybe there's some other<00:13:29.600><c> stuff</c><00:13:29.760><c> Yeah</c><00:13:30.000><c> like</c><00:13:30.160><c> game</c><00:13:30.399><c> programming</c> other stuff Yeah like game programming other stuff Yeah like game programming but<00:13:30.959><c> you</c><00:13:31.040><c>

myself as a tools engineer<00:14:40.240><c> So</c><00:14:40.720><c> at</c><00:14:40.959><c> my</c><00:14:41.120><c> time</c><00:14:41.279><c> at</c><00:14:41.519><c> my</c><00:14:42.000><c> my</c><00:14:42.240><c> jobs</c> engineer So at my time at my my jobs engineer So at my time at my my jobs typically<00:14:43.440><c> I</c><00:14:43.760><c> would</c><00:14:44.240><c> start</c><00:14:44.560><c> off</c><00:14:44.720><c> on</c><00:14:44.880><c> the</c><00:14:45.120><c> UI</c> typically I would start off on the UI typically I would start off on the UI and<00:14:45.920><c> then</c><00:14:46.079><c> they'd</c><00:14:46.240><c> be</c><00:14:46.320><c> like</c><00:14:46.399><c> \"Okay</c><00:14:46.639><c> well</c><00:14:46.800><c> hey</c> and then they'd be like \"Okay well hey and then they'd be like \"Okay well hey we<00:14:47.120><c> need</c><00:14:47.199><c> a</c><00:14:47.360><c> library</c><00:14:47.680><c> for</c><00:14:47.839><c> this</c><00:14:48.000><c> thing.\"</c><00:14:48.240><c> So</c> we need a library for this thing.\" So we need a library for this thing.\" So then<00:14:48.560><c> I'd</c><00:14:48.800><c> be</c><00:14:48.880><c> the</c><00:14:49.040><c> one</c><00:14:49.120><c> writing</c><00:14:49.440><c> like</c><00:14:49.680><c> the</c> then I'd be the one writing like the then I'd be the one writing like the library<00:14:50.240><c> So</c><00:14:50.399><c> in</c><00:14:51.240><c> 2012</c><00:14:52.240><c> 2013</c><00:14:52.880><c> I</c><00:14:53.040><c> was</c><00:14:53.120><c> writing</c><00:14:53.360><c> a</c> library So in 2012 2013 I was writing a library So in 2012 2013 I was writing a UI<00:14:54.079><c> library</c><00:14:54.480><c> for</c><00:14:55.440><c> the</c><00:14:55.680><c> web</c><00:14:55.920><c> that</c><00:14:56.160><c> can</c><00:14:56.320><c> behave</c> UI library for the web that can behave UI library for the web that can behave just<00:14:56.880><c> like</c><00:14:56.959><c> an</c><00:14:57.199><c> iPad</c><00:14:57.519><c> So</c><00:14:57.680><c> you</c><00:14:57.760><c> can</c><00:14:57.839><c> pinch</c><00:14:58.079><c> and</c> just like an iPad So you can pinch and just like an iPad So you can pinch and zoom<00:14:58.399><c> on</c><00:14:58.560><c> it</c><00:14:58.639><c> but</c><00:14:58.800><c> it's</c><00:14:58.959><c> still</c><00:14:59.040><c> a</c><00:14:59.199><c> web</c><00:14:59.360><c> page</c> zoom on it but it's still a web page zoom on it but it's still a web page because<00:14:59.760><c> we</c><00:14:59.920><c> didn't</c><00:15:00.079><c> have</c><00:15:00.160><c> any</c><00:15:00.320><c> of</c><00:15:00.399><c> that</c><00:15:00.560><c> stuff</c> because we didn't have any of that stuff because we didn't have any of that stuff back<00:15:00.880><c> then</c><00:15:01.120><c> It</c><00:15:01.199><c> was</c><00:15:01.279><c> a</c><00:15:01.440><c>

into</c><00:15:15.199><c> a</c><00:15:15.360><c> job</c><00:15:15.519><c> it's</c> every single time I got into a job it's every single time I got into a job it's like<00:15:15.839><c> okay</c><00:15:16.079><c> hey</c><00:15:16.480><c> we</c><00:15:16.639><c> need</c><00:15:16.800><c> to</c><00:15:16.880><c> do</c><00:15:16.959><c> a</c><00:15:17.040><c> library</c> like okay hey we need to do a library like okay hey we need to do a library Hey<00:15:17.680><c> can</c><00:15:17.839><c> you</c><00:15:17.920><c> work</c><00:15:18.079><c> on</c><00:15:18.240><c> a</c><00:15:18.480><c> build</c><00:15:18.720><c> system</c><00:15:19.360><c> so</c> Hey can you work on a build system so Hey can you work on a build system so back<00:15:19.839><c> then</c><00:15:20.160><c> there</c><00:15:20.320><c> was</c><00:15:20.399><c> no</c><00:15:20.639><c> Grunt</c><00:15:21.199><c> there</c><00:15:21.279><c> was</c> back then there was no Grunt there was back then there was no Grunt there was no<00:15:21.600><c> Gulp</c><00:15:22.000><c> there</c><00:15:22.160><c> was</c><00:15:22.240><c> no</c><00:15:22.399><c> any</c><00:15:22.639><c> of</c><00:15:22.720><c> those</c><00:15:22.880><c> things</c> no Gulp there was no any of those things no Gulp there was no any of those things So<00:15:23.279><c> I</c><00:15:23.440><c> had</c><00:15:23.600><c> to</c><00:15:23.760><c> hand</c><00:15:24.079><c> roll</c><00:15:24.639><c> my</c><00:15:24.959><c> own</c><00:15:25.199><c> JavaScript</c> So I had to hand roll my own JavaScript So I had to hand roll my own JavaScript build<00:15:26.160><c> system</c><00:15:26.639><c> And</c><00:15:26.800><c> so</c><00:15:26.880><c> I</c><00:15:27.120><c> always</c><00:15:27.279><c> fell</c><00:15:27.519><c> into</c> build system And so I always fell into build system And so I always fell into these<00:15:27.920><c> positions</c><00:15:28.320><c> of</c><00:15:28.480><c> building</c><00:15:28.800><c> tools</c><00:15:29.120><c> for</c> these positions of building tools for these positions of building tools for developers<00:15:29.920><c> to</c><00:15:30.160><c> be</c><00:15:30.360><c> successful</c><00:15:31.360><c> And</c><00:15:31.519><c> I've</c> developers to be successful And I've developers to be successful And I've always<00:15:32.000><c> really</c><00:15:32.320><c> enjoyed</c><00:15:32.720><c> that</c><00:15:32.959><c> region</c><00:15:33.279><c> And</c><00:15:33.440><c> so</c> always really enjoyed that region And so always really enjoyed that region And so as<00:15:33.760><c> I</c><00:15:33.920><c> went</c><00:15:34.399><c> on</c><00:15:34.720><c> to</c><00:15:35.040><c> say</c><00:15:35.279><c> Netflix</c><00:15:36.240><c> uh</c><00:15:36.320><c> spent</c><00:15:36.720><c> 10</c> as I went on to say Netflix uh spent 10 as I went on to say Netflix uh spent 10 years<00:15:37.120><c>

my years there I'd say the majority of my 10<00:15:39.040><c> years</c><00:15:39.279><c> were</c><00:15:39.600><c> building</c><00:15:39.920><c> things</c><00:15:40.240><c> for</c> 10 years were building things for 10 years were building things for developers<00:15:41.040><c> to</c> developers to developers to use<00:15:42.880><c> that</c><00:15:43.199><c> they</c><00:15:43.360><c> could</c><00:15:43.519><c> be</c><00:15:43.680><c> successful</c><00:15:44.320><c> at</c> use that they could be successful at use that they could be successful at their<00:15:44.800><c> job</c><00:15:45.600><c> And</c><00:15:45.760><c> so</c><00:15:45.920><c> I</c><00:15:46.079><c> just</c><00:15:46.240><c> I've</c><00:15:46.480><c> always</c> their job And so I just I've always

understand</c> that use your program understand that use your program understand programming<00:15:52.240><c> and</c><00:15:52.480><c> they're</c><00:15:52.639><c> going</c><00:15:52.720><c> to</c><00:15:52.880><c> say</c> programming and they're going to say programming and they're going to say like<00:15:53.199><c> \"Hey</c><00:15:53.440><c> I</c><00:15:53.680><c>

you know<00:16:06.639><c> that's</c><00:16:06.880><c> like</c><00:16:06.959><c> the</c><00:16:07.120><c> old</c><00:16:07.279><c> Henry</c><00:16:07.600><c> Ford</c> know that's like the old Henry Ford know that's like the old Henry Ford quote<00:16:08.160><c> I</c><00:16:08.320><c> just</c><00:16:08.399><c> want</c><00:16:08.480><c> a</c><00:16:08.639><c> faster</c><00:16:08.959><c>

figure<00:16:14.639><c> it</c><00:16:14.720><c> out</c><00:16:14.959><c> Whereas</c><00:16:15.279><c> developers</c><00:16:15.680><c> it's</c> figure it out Whereas developers it's figure it out Whereas developers it's like<00:16:16.079><c> I</c><00:16:16.240><c> know</c><00:16:16.560><c> you</c><00:16:16.800><c> know</c><00:16:16.959><c> what</c><00:16:17.120><c> I'm</c><00:16:17.279><c> doing</c><00:16:17.680><c> I</c> like I know you know what I'm doing I like I know you know what I'm doing I know<00:16:18.000><c> what</c><00:16:18.160><c> you</c><00:16:18.320><c> want</c><00:16:18.639><c> Let's</c><00:16:18.880><c> figure</c><00:16:19.040><c> it</c><00:16:19.199><c> out</c> know what you want Let's figure it out know what you want Let's figure it out together<00:16:20.160><c> That's</c><00:16:20.399><c> actually</c><00:16:20.720><c> that</c><00:16:21.040><c> gives</c><00:16:21.199><c> you</c> together That's actually that gives you together That's actually that gives you a<00:16:21.519><c> really</c><00:16:21.759><c> nice</c><00:16:22.000><c> big</c><00:16:22.240><c> picture</c><00:16:22.639><c> view</c><00:16:22.880><c> of</c> a really nice

love</c><00:16:24.880><c> the</c> programming in general So I love the programming in general So I love the idea<00:16:25.199><c> of</c><00:16:25.440><c> just</c><00:16:25.600><c> kind</c><00:16:25.759><c> of</c><00:16:26.040><c> starting</c><00:16:27.040><c> at</c><00:16:27.279><c> the</c> idea of just kind of starting at the idea of just kind of starting at the interface<00:16:28.399><c> like</c><00:16:28.720><c> you</c><00:16:28.959><c> need</c><00:16:29.040><c> to</c><00:16:29.199><c> pinch</c><00:16:29.519><c> and</c><00:16:29.759><c> all</c> interface like you need to pinch and all interface like you need to pinch and all that<00:16:30.079><c> kind</c><00:16:30.160><c> of</c><00:16:30.320><c> stuff</c><00:16:30.480><c> and</c><00:16:30.639><c> then</c><00:16:30.880><c> figure</c><00:16:31.120><c> out</c> that kind of stuff and then figure out that kind of stuff and then figure out the<00:16:31.600><c> entire</c><00:16:32.240><c> thing</c><00:16:32.480><c> that</c><00:16:32.800><c> requires</c><00:16:33.199><c> to</c><00:16:33.360><c> make</c> the entire thing that requires to make the entire thing that requires to make

it's</c><01:31:45.199><c> like</c><01:31:45.440><c> I</c><01:31:45.600><c> had</c><01:31:45.760><c> to</c><01:31:45.920><c> become</c> print And so it's like I had to become print And so it's like I had to become really<01:31:46.639><c> good</c><01:31:47.520><c> at</c><01:31:48.320><c> printing</c><01:31:48.719><c> my</c><01:31:48.960><c> way</c><01:31:49.120><c> through</c> really good at

Netflix<01:40:13.440><c> for</c><01:40:13.760><c> a</c><01:40:14.080><c> very</c><01:40:14.480><c> long</c><01:40:14.719><c> time</c><01:40:14.960><c> because</c><01:40:15.520><c> one</c> Netflix for

that</c><01:40:19.440><c> means</c><01:40:19.600><c> it</c><01:40:19.760><c> would</c><01:40:19.920><c> just</c><01:40:20.080><c> turn</c><01:40:20.320><c> it</c> And so that means it would just turn

fix forward<01:40:37.040><c> and</c><01:40:37.119><c> figure</c><01:40:37.280><c> out</c><01:40:37.440><c> No</c><01:40:37.600><c> it's</c><01:40:37.760><c> like</c><01:40:37.920><c> we</c> forward and figure out No it's like we forward and figure out No it's like we could<01:40:38.159><c> roll</c><01:40:38.400><c> back</c><01:40:38.560><c> to</c><01:40:39.159><c> 2011</c><01:40:40.159><c> Like</c><01:40:40.400><c> that's</c><01:40:40.560><c> our</c> could roll back to 2011 Like that's our could roll back to 2011 Like that's our option<01:40:41.040><c> is</c><01:40:41.360><c> 2011</c><01:40:42.080><c> and</c><01:40:42.320><c> that's</c><01:40:42.480><c> it</c><01:40:42.960><c> So</c><01:40:43.119><c> we</c><01:40:43.280><c> had</c> option is 2011 and that's it So we had option is 2011 and that's it So we had to<01:40:43.600><c> figure</c><01:40:43.679><c> out</c><01:40:43.840><c> a</c><01:40:44.000><c> way</c><01:40:44.159><c> forward</c><01:40:44.480><c> and</c><01:40:44.639><c> all</c><01:40:44.800><c> that</c> to figure out a way forward and all that to figure out a way forward and all that And<01:40:45.440><c> so</c><01:40:45.600><c> it's</c> And so it's And so it's like<01:40:48.320><c> the</c><01:40:48.639><c> amount</c><01:40:48.880><c> of</c><01:40:49.040><c> problems</c><01:40:49.360><c> that</c><01:40:49.679><c> would</c> like the amount

has<01:41:52.480><c> a</c><01:41:52.560><c> bunch</c><01:41:52.719><c> of</c><01:41:52.880><c> utilities</c><01:41:53.360><c> all</c><01:41:53.600><c> built</c><01:41:53.840><c> in</c> has a bunch of

is</c><01:41:56.040><c> why</c> cuz you know obviously this is why cuz you know obviously this is why everyone<01:41:57.360><c> hates</c><01:41:57.679><c> all</c><01:41:57.840><c> these</c><01:41:58.159><c> Bluetooth</c> everyone hates all these Bluetooth everyone hates all these Bluetooth devices<01:41:58.960><c> that</c><01:41:59.119><c> connect</c><01:41:59.360><c> to</c><01:41:59.520><c> the</c><01:41:59.600><c> internet</c> devices that connect to the internet devices that connect to the internet because<01:42:00.080><c> they</c><01:42:00.239><c> just</c><01:42:00.320><c> turn</c><01:42:00.480><c> into</c><01:42:00.719><c> attack</c> because they just turn into attack because they just turn into attack vectors<01:42:01.360><c> where</c><01:42:01.600><c> people</c><01:42:01.760><c> use</c><01:42:01.920><c> those</c><01:42:02.080><c> to</c><01:42:02.320><c> do</c> vectors where people use those to do vectors where people use

or DDoS other sites And so you DOSs or DDoS other sites And so you don't<01:42:04.960><c> need</c><01:42:05.199><c> something</c><01:42:05.520><c> sophisticated</c><01:42:06.239><c> You</c> don't need

you</c><01:42:08.320><c> can</c><01:42:08.400><c> take</c><01:42:08.560><c> down</c><01:42:08.800><c> websites</c><01:42:09.280><c> And</c><01:42:09.440><c> so</c> and you can take down websites And

that</c><01:44:11.440><c> discovering</c><01:44:12.000><c> a</c> thing is is that discovering a thing is is that discovering a vulnerability<01:44:13.360><c> and</c><01:44:13.600><c>

the</c><01:44:15.520><c> white</c><01:44:15.679><c> hat</c><01:44:15.920><c> hacker</c><01:44:16.239><c> still</c><01:44:16.480><c> has</c><01:44:16.639><c> to</c> know the white hat hacker still has to know the white hat hacker still has to make<01:44:16.960><c> that</c><01:44:17.199><c> same</c><01:44:17.360><c> discovery</c><01:44:18.480><c> Yeah</c><01:44:18.880><c> And</c><01:44:19.119><c> that's</c> make that same discovery Yeah And that's make that same discovery Yeah And that's where<01:44:19.520><c> I</c><01:44:19.679><c> think</c><01:44:19.760><c> the</c><01:44:19.920><c>

is</c><01:49:41.040><c> obviously</c> on a singular project it is obviously on a singular project it is obviously much<01:49:41.760><c> easier</c><01:49:42.080><c> for</c><01:49:42.320><c> you</c><01:49:42.639><c> to</c><01:49:42.880><c> push</c><01:49:43.119><c> directly</c><01:49:43.520><c> to</c> much easier for you to push directly to much easier for you to push directly to

to me that makes sense discover it So to me that makes sense Like<01:49:51.280><c> I</c><01:49:51.440><c> think</c><01:49:51.520><c> the</c><01:49:51.760><c> way</c><01:49:51.840><c> he</c><01:49:52.080><c> operates</c><01:49:52.400><c> is</c> Like I think the way he operates is Like I think the way he operates is perfect<01:49:52.880><c> for</c><01:49:53.119><c> what</c><01:49:53.280><c> he</c><01:49:53.440><c> does</c><01:49:54.239><c> you</c><01:49:54.480><c> couldn't</c> perfect for what he does you couldn't perfect for what he does you couldn't

say</c> take what he does and move it to say take what he does and move it to say Microsoft<01:49:56.880><c> or</c><01:49:57.119><c> Netflix</c><01:49:57.520><c> or</c><01:49:57.760><c> Google</c><01:49:58.000><c> because</c> Microsoft or Netflix or Google because Microsoft or Netflix or Google because that<01:49:58.400><c> would</c><01:49:58.560><c> obviously</c><01:49:59.199><c> it</c><01:49:59.440><c> would</c><01:49:59.520><c> just</c><01:49:59.679><c> be</c><01:49:59.760><c> a</c> that would obviously it would just be a that would obviously it would just be a disaster<01:50:00.719><c> just</c><01:50:00.880><c> due</c><01:50:01.119><c> to</c><01:50:01.199><c> the</c><01:50:01.360><c> amount</c><01:50:01.520><c> of</c> disaster just due to the amount of

done</c><01:52:27.760><c> really</c> because you can get the job done really because you can get the job done really fast<01:52:28.400><c> and</c><01:52:28.719><c> there's</c><01:52:28.960><c> no</c><01:52:29.599><c> significant</c> fast and there's no significant fast and there's no significant performance<01:52:30.480><c> hit</c><01:52:30.719><c> that</c><01:52:31.199><c> that</c><01:52:31.520><c> you</c><01:52:32.000><c> detect</c><01:52:32.560><c> So</c> performance hit that that you detect So performance hit that that you detect So like<01:52:32.960><c> why</c><01:52:33.280><c> switch</c><01:52:33.599><c> to</c><01:52:33.840><c> something</c><01:52:34.000><c> else</c><01:52:34.960><c> but</c> like why switch to something else but like why switch to something else but it's<01:52:35.360><c> always</c><01:52:35.599><c> probably</c><01:52:35.920><c> as</c><01:52:36.159><c> we'll</c><01:52:36.400><c> talk</c><01:52:36.560><c> about</c> it's always probably as we'll talk about it's always probably as we'll talk about good<01:52:37.199><c> to</c><01:52:37.679><c> explore</c><01:52:38.159><c> and</c><01:52:38.400><c> to</c><01:52:38.639><c> learn</c><01:52:39.440><c> Not</c><01:52:39.760><c> all</c> good to explore and to learn Not all good to explore and to learn Not all tools<01:52:40.400><c> are</c><01:52:40.639><c> great</c><01:52:40.800><c> at</c><01:52:41.040><c> solving</c><01:52:41.360><c> all</c><01:52:41.719><c> problems</c> tools are great at solving all problems tools are great at solving all problems And<01:52:43.040><c> so</c><01:52:43.679><c> what</c><01:52:44.000><c> you</c><01:52:44.239><c> think</c><01:52:44.400><c> is</c><01:52:44.719><c> really</c><01:52:45.440><c> like</c><01:52:45.920><c> the</c> And so what you think is really like the And so what you think is really like the problem<01:52:46.239><c> is</c><01:52:46.400><c> is</c><01:52:46.639><c> you</c><01:52:46.800><c> run</c><01:52:46.960><c> into</c><01:52:47.119><c> this</c><01:52:47.360><c> kind</c><01:52:47.520><c> of</c> problem is is you run into this kind of problem is is you run into this kind of trade-off<01:52:48.159><c> which</c><01:52:48.400><c> is</c><01:52:48.719><c> you</c><01:52:49.040><c> have</c><01:52:49.520><c> some</c><01:52:50.159><c> tool</c> trade-off which is you have some tool trade-off which is you have some tool belt<01:52:51.199><c> that</c><01:52:51.440><c> you're</c><01:52:51.679><c> very</c><01:52:52.000><c> adept</c><01:52:52.480><c> with</c><01:52:52.960><c>

know what you're building<01:52:59.119><c> You</c><01:52:59.280><c> know</c><01:52:59.360><c> what</c><01:52:59.520><c> you're</c><01:52:59.599><c> getting</c> building You know what you're getting building You know what you're getting into<01:53:00.480><c> You</c><01:53:00.719><c> will</c><01:53:00.960><c> go</c><01:53:01.480><c> through</c><01:53:02.480><c> and</c><01:53:03.760><c> um</c><01:53:03.920><c> you</c><01:53:04.159><c> will</c> into You will go through and um you will into You will go through and um you will be<01:53:04.400><c> able</c><01:53:04.560><c> to</c><01:53:04.639><c> solve</c><01:53:04.800><c> the</c><01:53:05.040><c> problem</c><01:53:06.000><c> But</c><01:53:06.159><c> if</c><01:53:06.320><c> you</c> be able to solve the problem But if you be able to solve the problem But if you ever<01:53:06.719><c> use</c><01:53:07.440><c> a</c><01:53:07.760><c> different</c><01:53:08.000><c> language</c><01:53:08.400><c> or</c><01:53:08.639><c> a</c> ever use a different language or a ever use a different language or a different<01:53:09.040><c> experience</c><01:53:09.520><c> you</c><01:53:09.679><c> can</c><01:53:09.760><c> find</c><01:53:09.920><c> that</c> different experience you can find that different experience you can find that some<01:53:10.400><c> things</c><01:53:10.719><c> are</c><01:53:10.880><c> able</c><01:53:11.119><c> to</c><01:53:11.280><c> represent</c><01:53:11.840><c> states</c> some things are able to represent states some things are able to represent states way<01:53:12.800><c> easier</c><01:53:13.440><c> in</c><01:53:13.679><c> a</c><01:53:13.840><c> way</c><01:53:14.000><c> more</c><01:53:14.159><c> efficient</c><01:53:14.480><c> way</c> way easier in a way more efficient way way easier in a way more efficient way and<01:53:14.719><c> you</c><01:53:14.880><c> can</c><01:53:14.960><c> solve</c><01:53:15.199><c> problems</c><01:53:15.679><c> really</c> and you can solve problems really and you can solve problems really efficiently<01:53:16.560><c> in</c><01:53:16.880><c> some</c><01:53:17.440><c> versus</c><01:53:17.760><c> the</c><01:53:18.000><c> other</c><01:53:18.159><c> And</c> efficiently in some versus the other And efficiently in some versus the other And so<01:53:18.400><c> it's</c><01:53:18.639><c> like</c><01:53:18.960><c> if</c><01:53:19.199><c> you</c><01:53:19.360><c> don't</c><01:53:19.520><c> take</c><01:53:19.599><c> the</c><01:53:19.840><c> time</c> so it's like if you don't take the time so it's like if you don't take the time to<01:53:20.080><c> explore</c><01:53:20.400><c> as</c><01:53:20.639><c> well</c><01:53:21.040><c> you</c><01:53:21.199><c> could</c><01:53:21.360><c> be</c><01:53:21.520><c> missing</c> to explore as well you could be missing to explore as well you could be missing out<01:53:21.920><c> on</c><01:53:22.080><c> something</c><01:53:22.239><c> that</c><01:53:22.400><c> makes</c><01:53:22.560><c> you</c><01:53:22.800><c> twice</c><01:53:23.040><c> as</c> out on something that makes you twice as out on something that makes you twice as good<01:53:23.440><c> on</c><01:53:23.599><c> this</c><01:53:23.840><c> one</c><01:53:24.000><c> specific</c><01:53:24.400><c> problem</c><01:53:24.800><c> like</c> good on this one specific problem like good on this one specific problem like subset<01:53:25.840><c> And</c><01:53:26.000><c> so</c><01:53:26.159><c> I</c><01:53:26.320><c> kind</c><01:53:26.400><c> of</c><01:53:26.560><c> value</c><01:53:27.040><c> being</c><01:53:27.280><c> able</c> subset And so I kind of value being able subset And so I kind of value being able to<01:53:27.599><c> look</c><01:53:27.760><c> at</c><01:53:28.080><c> all</c><01:53:28.320><c> problems</c><01:53:28.880><c> And</c><01:53:29.040><c> so</c><01:53:29.199><c> I</c><01:53:29.440><c> don't</c> to look at all problems And so I don't to look at all problems And so I don't want<01:53:29.679><c> to</c><01:53:29.840><c> get</c><01:53:30.000><c> stuck</c><01:53:30.159><c> on</c><01:53:30.320><c> one</c><01:53:30.560><c> thing</c><01:53:30.719><c> though</c><01:53:30.960><c> I</c> want to get stuck on one thing though I want to get stuck on one thing though I see<01:53:31.280><c> why</c><01:53:31.599><c> people</c><01:53:31.840><c>

efficiency<01:53:33.199><c> sake</c> efficiency sake efficiency sake Let's<01:53:34.719><c> just</c><01:53:34.960><c> return</c><01:53:35.199><c> to</c><01:53:35.360><c> the</c><01:53:35.599><c>

start</c><02:23:02.319><c> building</c> things So then when I start building things So then when I start building again<02:23:03.280><c> I</c><02:23:03.680><c> remember</c><02:23:04.000><c> okay</c><02:23:04.240><c> I</c><02:23:04.399><c> know</c><02:23:04.479><c> there's</c><02:23:04.640><c> a</c> again I remember okay I know there's a again I remember okay I know there's a thing<02:23:04.960><c> over</c><02:23:05.200><c> here</c><02:23:05.520><c> Let</c><02:23:05.680><c> me</c><02:23:05.760><c> go</c><02:23:05.920><c> reread</c><02:23:06.319><c> about</c> thing over here Let me go reread about thing over here Let me go reread about it<02:23:06.560><c> because</c><02:23:06.800><c> now</c><02:23:06.960><c> I</c><02:23:07.040><c> have</c><02:23:07.200><c> it</c><02:23:07.359><c> indexed</c><02:23:07.760><c> in</c><02:23:07.920><c> my</c> it because now I have it indexed in my it because now I have it indexed in my brain<02:23:08.240><c>

uh</c><02:24:49.520><c> AI</c><02:24:49.840><c> is</c><02:24:50.160><c> is</c><02:24:50.160><c> is</c><02:24:50.560><c> a</c><02:24:50.800><c> huge</c> learning right now uh AI is is is a huge learning right now uh AI is is is a huge help<02:24:51.520><c> but</c><02:24:51.760><c> I</c><02:24:52.000><c> already</c><02:24:52.160><c> have</c><02:24:52.240><c> a</c><02:24:52.399><c>

that's</c><02:24:56.000><c> a</c><02:24:56.160><c> good</c><02:24:56.319><c> idea</c> from scratch whether that's a good idea from scratch whether that's a good idea but<02:24:56.880><c> I</c><02:24:57.200><c> still</c><02:24:57.359><c> think</c><02:24:57.520><c> it's</c><02:24:57.680><c> probably</c><02:24:57.840><c> a</c><02:24:58.000><c> really</c> but I still think it's probably a really but I still think it's probably a really good<02:24:58.319><c> idea</c><02:24:58.720><c> But</c><02:24:59.000><c> basically</c><02:25:00.000><c> generate</c><02:25:00.479><c> some</c> good idea

by</c><02:28:40.720><c> building</c> learn that you learn that by building learn that you learn that by building from<02:28:41.280><c> scratch</c><02:28:42.160><c> So</c><02:28:42.399><c> both</c><02:28:42.640><c> are</c><02:28:42.880><c> probably</c><02:28:43.120><c> really</c> from scratch So both are probably really from scratch So both are probably really necessary<02:28:44.560><c> Yeah</c><02:28:44.880><c> But</c><02:28:45.120><c> I</c><02:28:45.280><c> think</c><02:28:45.359><c> as</c><02:28:45.600><c> a</c><02:28:45.840><c> first</c> necessary Yeah But I think as a first

step of learning how to program it's step of learning how to program it's pretty<02:28:49.280><c> it's</c><02:28:49.600><c> pretty</c><02:28:49.840><c> nice</c><02:28:50.080><c> to</c><02:28:50.319><c> generate</c><02:28:50.720><c> a</c> pretty it's pretty nice to generate a pretty it's pretty nice to generate a function<02:28:51.280><c> to</c><02:28:51.520><c>

to say a couple<02:39:58.399><c> languages</c><02:39:58.880><c> and</c><02:39:59.120><c> you</c><02:39:59.280><c> should</c><02:40:00.080><c> at</c><02:40:00.160><c> least</c> couple languages and you should at least couple languages and you should at least explore<02:40:00.960><c> some</c><02:40:01.120><c> of</c><02:40:01.280><c> them</c><02:40:01.760><c> I</c><02:40:02.080><c> think</c><02:40:02.160><c> you</c><02:40:02.399><c> should</c> explore some of them I think you should explore some of them I think you should explore<02:40:03.280><c> explore</c><02:40:03.760><c> a</c><02:40:03.920><c> Lucy</c><02:40:04.319><c> language</c><02:40:04.960><c> So</c><02:40:05.359><c> uh</c> explore explore a Lucy language So uh explore explore a Lucy language So uh Python/JavaScript<02:40:06.880><c> where</c><02:40:07.040><c> there</c><02:40:07.280><c> is</c><02:40:07.520><c> truly</c> Python/JavaScript where there is truly Python/JavaScript where there is truly

which is a boxed value only one type which is a boxed value which<02:40:09.840><c> is</c><02:40:09.920><c> a</c><02:40:10.240><c> multivariant</c><02:40:10.960><c> different</c><02:40:11.120><c>

would</c><02:40:12.960><c> you</c><02:40:13.040><c> call</c> underneath the hood right would you call underneath the hood right would you call it<02:40:13.280><c> a</c><02:40:13.439><c> Lucy</c><02:40:13.760><c> language</c><02:40:14.160><c> a</c><02:40:14.319><c> loosey</c><02:40:14.640><c> goosey</c> it a Lucy language a loosey goosey it a Lucy language a loosey goosey language<02:40:15.280><c> right</c><02:40:15.520><c> it's</c><02:40:15.680><c> a</c><02:40:15.840><c> dynamic</c><02:40:16.240><c> language</c> language right it's a dynamic language language right it's a dynamic language Okay<02:40:17.120><c> Um</c><02:40:17.520><c> and</c><02:40:17.680><c> so</c><02:40:17.840><c> I</c><02:40:18.000><c> think</c><02:40:18.080><c> it's</c><02:40:18.399><c> really</c><02:40:18.640><c> good</c> Okay Um and so I think it's really good Okay Um and so I think it's really good to<02:40:18.960><c> explore</c><02:40:19.280><c> one</c><02:40:19.439><c> of</c><02:40:19.520><c> those</c><02:40:19.680><c> two</c><02:40:19.840><c> So</c><02:40:20.000><c> I'd</c><02:40:20.160><c> put</c> to explore one of those two So I'd put to explore one of those two So I'd put Python<02:40:20.560><c> or</c><02:40:20.880><c> JavaScript</c><02:40:21.280><c> right</c><02:40:21.439><c> there</c><02:40:21.680><c> Even</c> Python or JavaScript right there Even Python or JavaScript right there Even Lua<02:40:22.160><c> throw</c><02:40:22.399><c> Lua</c><02:40:22.640><c> in</c><02:40:22.800><c> the</c><02:40:22.880><c> bunch</c><02:40:23.280><c> I</c><02:40:23.520><c> think</c><02:40:23.600><c> you</c> Lua throw Lua in the bunch I think you Lua throw Lua in the bunch I think you should<02:40:23.920><c> explore</c><02:40:24.160><c> a</c><02:40:24.399><c> strict</c><02:40:24.720><c> language</c><02:40:25.520><c> Uh</c><02:40:25.760><c> so</c> should explore a strict language Uh so should explore a strict language Uh so I'd<02:40:26.160><c> do</c><02:40:26.319><c> something</c><02:40:26.640><c> like</c><02:40:27.120><c> Rust</c><02:40:27.840><c> Go</c><02:40:29.200><c> Um</c><02:40:29.600><c> I</c><02:40:29.840><c> think</c> I'd do something like Rust Go Um I think I'd do something like Rust Go Um I think those<02:40:30.160><c> are</c><02:40:30.319><c> both</c><02:40:30.560><c> really</c><02:40:30.720><c> really</c><02:40:30.960><c> great</c><02:40:31.359><c> C++</c> those are both really really great C++ those are both really really great C++ you<02:40:32.399><c> can</c><02:40:32.479><c>

there's nothing to it and so the there's nothing to it and so the compiler<02:44:30.640><c> can</c><02:44:30.800><c> make</c><02:44:30.960><c> these</c><02:44:31.200><c> really</c><02:44:31.359><c> cool</c><02:44:31.840><c> uh</c> compiler can make these really cool uh compiler can make these really cool uh optimizations<02:44:33.520><c> And</c><02:44:33.680><c> I</c><02:44:33.920><c> made</c><02:44:34.080><c> it</c><02:44:34.240><c> faster</c><02:44:34.560><c> than</c> optimizations And I made it faster than optimizations And I made it faster than the<02:44:34.880><c> C</c><02:44:35.399><c> version</c><02:44:36.399><c> So</c><02:44:36.560><c> it</c><02:44:36.720><c> just</c><02:44:36.880><c> means</c><02:44:37.040><c> that</c><02:44:37.279><c> just</c> the C

to I love that it's that uh the ability to free<02:46:36.479><c> the</c><02:46:36.720><c> memory</c><02:46:37.040><c> that</c><02:46:37.200><c> you're</c><02:46:37.439><c> using</c><02:46:37.600><c> is</c> free the memory that you're using is free the memory that you're using is directly<02:46:38.240><c> tied</c><02:46:38.479><c> to</c><02:46:38.640><c> the</c><02:46:38.840><c> stack</c><02:46:39.840><c> So</c><02:46:40.080><c> whenever</c> directly tied to the stack So whenever directly tied to the stack So whenever you<02:46:40.800><c> create</c><02:46:41.200><c> something</c><02:46:41.680><c> there's</c><02:46:41.920><c> a</c><02:46:42.160><c> stack</c> you create something there's a stack you create something there's a stack variable<02:46:42.880><c> or</c><02:46:43.200><c> there's</c><02:46:43.439><c> some</c><02:46:43.680><c> amount</c><02:46:43.920><c> of</c><02:46:44.080><c> stack</c> variable or there's some amount of stack variable or there's some amount of stack memory<02:46:44.720><c> whether</c><02:46:44.960><c> it's</c><02:46:45.120><c> a</c><02:46:45.279><c> pointer</c><02:46:45.600><c> off</c><02:46:45.920><c> to</c><02:46:46.080><c> the</c> memory whether it's a pointer off to the memory whether it's a pointer off to the heap<02:46:46.800><c> a</c><02:46:46.960><c> pointer</c><02:46:47.359><c> and</c><02:46:47.439><c> a</c><02:46:47.600><c> length</c><02:46:48.160><c> So</c><02:46:48.319><c> you</c><02:46:48.479><c> know</c> heap a pointer and a length So you know heap a pointer and a length So you know some<02:46:48.880><c> amount</c><02:46:49.120><c> of</c><02:46:49.279><c> memory</c><02:46:49.520><c> on</c><02:46:49.760><c> the</c><02:46:49.920><c> stack</c><02:46:50.160><c> and</c> some amount of memory on the stack and some amount of memory on the stack and then<02:46:50.479><c> some</c><02:46:50.880><c> memory</c><02:46:51.120><c> on</c><02:46:51.279><c> the</c><02:46:51.359><c> heap</c><02:46:51.680><c> because</c> then some memory on the heap because then some memory on the heap because like<02:46:52.160><c> a</c><02:46:52.319><c> string</c><02:46:52.800><c> is</c><02:46:53.040><c> not</c><02:46:53.200><c> all</c><02:46:53.439><c> on</c><02:46:53.600><c> the</c><02:46:53.760><c> stack</c> like a string is not all on the stack like a string is not all on the stack It's<02:46:54.479><c> some</c><02:46:54.640><c> on</c><02:46:54.720><c> the</c><02:46:54.800><c> heap</c><02:46:55.200><c> some</c><02:46:55.359><c> on</c><02:46:55.520><c> the</c><02:46:55.600><c> stack</c> It's some on the heap some on the stack It's some on the heap some on the stack And<02:46:56.399><c> when</c><02:46:56.640><c> that</c><02:46:56.880><c> stack</c><02:46:57.279><c> variable</c><02:46:57.680><c> goes</c><02:46:58.000><c> out</c><02:46:58.160><c> of</c> And when that stack variable goes out of And when that stack variable goes out of scope<02:46:58.560><c> and</c><02:46:58.800><c> gets</c><02:46:59.040><c> cleaned</c><02:46:59.279><c> up</c><02:47:00.080><c> it</c><02:47:00.319><c> also</c><02:47:00.640><c> cleans</c> scope and gets cleaned up it also cleans scope and gets cleaned up it also cleans up<02:47:00.960><c> what's</c><02:47:01.200><c> on</c><02:47:01.359><c> the</c><02:47:01.439><c> heap</c><02:47:01.920><c> So</c><02:47:02.080><c> it</c><02:47:02.240><c> kind</c><02:47:02.399><c> of</c> up what's on the heap So it kind of up what's on the heap So it kind of simplifies<02:47:03.120><c> this</c><02:47:03.359><c> whole</c><02:47:03.600><c> idea</c><02:47:03.840><c> of</c><02:47:04.479><c> whoops</c><02:47:04.880><c> I</c> simplifies this whole idea of whoops I simplifies this whole idea of whoops I forgot<02:47:05.359><c> to</c><02:47:05.520><c> free</c><02:47:05.760><c> my</c><02:47:06.000><c> memory</c><02:47:06.319><c> It</c><02:47:06.479><c> just</c><02:47:06.640><c> does</c><02:47:06.800><c> it</c> forgot to free my memory It just does it forgot to free my memory It just does it for<02:47:07.200><c> you</c><02:47:07.439><c> So</c><02:47:07.600><c> it's</c><02:47:07.760><c> not</c><02:47:07.840><c> a</c><02:47:08.000><c> garbage</c><02:47:08.319><c> collector</c> for you So it's not a garbage collector for you So it's not a garbage collector which<02:47:09.040><c> will</c><02:47:09.200><c> do</c><02:47:09.279><c> it</c><02:47:09.439><c> sometime</c><02:47:09.840><c> later</c><02:47:10.640><c> It's</c><02:47:10.960><c> not</c> which will do it sometime later It's not which will do it sometime later It's not like<02:47:11.680><c> C</c><02:47:12.000><c> where</c><02:47:12.160><c> you</c><02:47:12.399><c> have</c><02:47:12.479><c> to</c><02:47:12.640><c> call</c><02:47:12.800><c> it</c> like C where you have to call it like C where you have to call it yourself<02:47:13.439><c> It's</c><02:47:13.680><c> somewhere</c><02:47:14.000><c> in</c><02:47:14.240><c> between</c><02:47:14.800><c> Now</c> yourself It's somewhere in between Now yourself It's somewhere in between Now there's<02:47:15.439><c> a</c><02:47:15.600><c> lot</c><02:47:15.680><c> of</c><02:47:15.760><c> strategies</c><02:47:16.240><c> people</c><02:47:16.479><c> use</c> there's a lot of strategies people use there's a lot of strategies people use um<02:47:17.120><c> arenas</c><02:47:17.520><c> and</c><02:47:17.680><c> all</c><02:47:17.840><c> that</c><02:47:18.000><c> that</c><02:47:18.240><c> make</c><02:47:18.720><c> that</c><02:47:18.960><c> C</c> um arenas and all that that make that C um arenas and all that that make that C part<02:47:19.439><c> much</c><02:47:19.680><c> easier</c><02:47:19.920><c> I'm</c><02:47:20.160><c> just</c><02:47:20.319><c> not</c><02:47:20.479><c> even</c> part much easier I'm just not even part much easier I'm just not even mentioning<02:47:20.880><c> it</c><02:47:20.960><c> but</c><02:47:21.200><c> it</c><02:47:21.279><c> just</c><02:47:21.439><c> makes</c><02:47:21.520><c> it</c><02:47:21.600><c> a</c><02:47:21.760><c> lot</c> mentioning it but it just makes it a lot mentioning it but it just makes it a lot easier<02:47:22.880><c> But</c><02:47:23.120><c> Russ</c><02:47:23.439><c> does</c><02:47:23.680><c> that</c><02:47:23.840><c> really</c> easier But Russ does that really easier But Russ does that really beautifully<02:47:24.560><c> and</c><02:47:24.800><c> it's</c><02:47:24.960><c> just</c><02:47:25.200><c> like</c><02:47:25.359><c> a</c><02:47:25.600><c> really</c> beautifully and it's just like a really beautifully and it's just like a really cool<02:47:26.479><c> idea</c><02:47:27.040><c> about</c><02:47:27.359><c> it</c><02:47:27.680><c> and</c><02:47:27.920><c> I</c><02:47:28.080><c> really</c><02:47:28.319><c> like</c> cool idea about it and I really like cool idea about it and I really like that<02:47:28.720><c> And</c><02:47:28.880><c> the</c><02:47:29.040><c> second</c><02:47:29.279><c> thing</c><02:47:29.359><c> that</c><02:47:29.520><c> I</c><02:47:29.680><c> think</c> that And the second thing that I think that And the second thing that I think Russ<02:47:30.160><c> does</c><02:47:30.479><c> really</c><02:47:30.880><c> like</c><02:47:31.200><c> is</c><02:47:31.439><c> such</c><02:47:31.760><c> a</c><02:47:32.080><c> good</c> Russ does really like is such a good Russ does really like is such a good thing<02:47:33.120><c> is</c><02:47:33.439><c> that</c><02:47:33.840><c> mutability</c><02:47:34.640><c> of</c><02:47:35.040><c> something</c><02:47:36.000><c> is</c> thing is that mutability of something is thing is that mutability of something is you<02:47:37.120><c> have</c><02:47:37.200><c> to</c><02:47:37.359><c> specify</c><02:47:37.840><c> it</c><02:47:38.800><c> So</c><02:47:39.120><c> you</c><02:47:39.359><c> don't</c><02:47:39.520><c> just</c> you have to specify it So you don't just you have to specify it So you don't just create<02:47:40.160><c> a</c><02:47:40.479><c> variable</c><02:47:40.880><c> and</c><02:47:41.120><c> then</c><02:47:41.279><c> mutate</c><02:47:41.680><c> it</c><02:47:41.920><c> You</c> create a variable and then mutate it You create a variable and then mutate it You have<02:47:42.080><c> to</c><02:47:42.240><c> say</c><02:47:42.399><c> this</c><02:47:42.560><c> is</c><02:47:42.640><c> not</c><02:47:42.800><c> only</c><02:47:42.960><c> a</c><02:47:43.120><c> variable</c> have to say this is not only a variable have to say this is not only a variable it's<02:47:43.680><c> a</c><02:47:43.840><c> mutable</c><02:47:44.319><c> variable</c><02:47:44.800><c> M</c><02:47:45.040><c> and</c><02:47:45.120><c> I</c><02:47:45.279><c> think</c> it's a mutable variable M and I think it's a mutable variable M and I think that<02:47:45.520><c> just</c><02:47:45.680><c> makes</c><02:47:45.920><c> code</c><02:47:46.319><c> really</c><02:47:46.720><c> readable</c><02:47:47.040><c> and</c> that just makes code really readable and that just makes code really readable and really<02:47:47.680><c> understandable</c><02:47:48.479><c> cuz</c><02:47:48.720><c> anything</c><02:47:49.040><c> that</c> really understandable cuz anything that really understandable cuz anything that does<02:47:49.439><c> not</c><02:47:49.600><c> have</c><02:47:49.680><c> the</c><02:47:49.840><c> word</c><02:47:50.080><c> mute</c><02:47:50.399><c> next</c><02:47:50.560><c> to</c><02:47:50.640><c> it</c> does not have the word mute next to it does not have the word mute next to it you<02:47:51.279><c> know</c><02:47:51.439><c> for</c><02:47:51.600><c> a</c><02:47:51.760><c> fact</c><02:47:52.000><c> it</c><02:47:52.160><c> cannot</c><02:47:52.479><c> change</c> you know for a fact it cannot change you know for a fact it cannot change So<02:47:55.040><c> there's</c><02:47:55.279><c> some</c><02:47:55.359><c> rules</c><02:47:55.680><c> around</c><02:47:55.840><c> that</c><02:47:56.000><c> but</c> So there's some rules around that but So there's some rules around that but you<02:47:56.319><c> get</c><02:47:56.399><c> the</c><02:47:56.560><c> general</c><02:47:56.800><c> idea</c><02:47:57.120><c>

meta programming is also the is that the meta programming is also the language<02:49:18.880><c> itself</c><02:49:20.000><c> So</c><02:49:20.240><c> you</c><02:49:20.399><c> don't</c><02:49:20.479><c> have</c><02:49:20.560><c> to</c> language itself So you don't have to language itself So you don't have to like<02:49:20.960><c> there's</c><02:49:21.120><c> not</c><02:49:21.359><c> there's</c><02:49:21.680><c> not</c><02:49:21.760><c> an</c> like there's not there's not an like there's not there's not an alternative<02:49:22.880><c> So</c><02:49:23.120><c>

Zigg</c> have to do the macro syntax With Zigg have to do the macro syntax With Zigg it's<02:49:28.319><c> just</c><02:49:28.479><c> it</c><02:49:28.720><c> is</c><02:49:28.800><c> the</c><02:49:28.960><c> thing</c><02:49:29.200><c> You</c><02:49:29.359><c> just</c> it's just it is the thing You just it's just it is the thing You just program<02:49:29.680><c> it</c><02:49:30.000><c> You</c><02:49:30.080><c> add</c><02:49:30.240><c> the</c><02:49:30.319><c> word</c><02:49:30.479><c> comp</c><02:49:30.800><c> time</c><02:49:30.960><c> if</c> program it You add the word comp time if program it You add the word comp time if you<02:49:31.200><c> want</c><02:49:31.279><c> it</c><02:49:31.439><c> to</c><02:49:31.520><c> be</c><02:49:31.600><c>

you<02:49:33.520><c> can</c><02:49:33.600><c> do</c><02:49:33.760><c> like</c><02:49:34.319><c> you</c><02:49:34.600><c> can</c><02:49:35.600><c> create</c><02:49:36.080><c> the</c><02:49:36.399><c> list</c> you can do like you can create the list you can do like you can create the list of<02:49:36.800><c> prime</c><02:49:37.200><c> numbers</c><02:49:37.520><c> at</c><02:49:37.760><c>

is</c><02:49:39.200><c> kind</c><02:49:39.279><c> of</c><02:49:39.359><c> an</c><02:49:39.800><c> interesting</c><02:49:40.800><c> unique</c> which is kind of an interesting unique which is kind of an interesting unique thing<02:49:41.520><c> So</c><02:49:41.600><c> you</c><02:49:41.760><c> have</c><02:49:41.920><c> code</c><02:49:42.080><c> that</c><02:49:42.240><c> executes</c><02:49:42.640><c> at</c> thing So you have code that executes at thing So you have code that executes at compile<02:49:43.040><c> time</c><02:49:43.200><c> and</c><02:49:43.359><c> then</c><02:49:43.439><c> you</c><02:49:43.600><c> can</c><02:49:43.760><c> take</c> compile time and then you can take compile time and then you can take advantage<02:49:44.319><c> of</c><02:49:44.479><c> the</c><02:49:44.800><c> result</c><02:49:44.960><c> of</c><02:49:45.120><c> it</c><02:49:45.359><c> at</c><02:49:45.640><c> runtime</c> advantage of the result of it at runtime advantage of the result of it at runtime So<02:49:47.520><c> neat</c><02:49:47.920><c> right</c><02:49:48.160><c> like</c><02:49:48.319><c> that's</c><02:49:48.560><c> how</c><02:49:48.640><c> I'd</c><02:49:48.880><c> look</c> So neat right like that's how I'd look So neat right like that's how I'd look at<02:49:49.200><c> it</c><02:49:49.680><c> Uh</c><02:49:50.240><c> but</c><02:49:50.560><c>

by And I had Twitch chat beat level one by spamming<02:51:55.520><c> it</c><02:51:55.760><c> But</c><02:51:55.920><c> the</c><02:51:56.080><c> fun</c><02:51:56.240><c> part</c><02:51:56.319><c> was</c><02:51:56.640><c> I</c><02:51:56.960><c> used</c> spamming it But the fun part was I used spamming it But the fun part was I used a<02:51:57.279><c> bunch</c><02:51:57.359><c>

to</c><02:52:00.560><c> take</c> used like quad trees to be able to take used like quad trees to be able to take smaller<02:52:01.120><c> amounts</c><02:52:01.359><c> to</c><02:52:01.520><c> use</c><02:52:01.680><c> run</c><02:52:02.000><c> length</c> smaller amounts to use run length smaller amounts to use run length encoding<02:52:02.960><c> Tried</c><02:52:03.200><c> to</c><02:52:03.520><c> create</c><02:52:03.760><c> my</c><02:52:04.000><c> own</c> encoding Tried to create my own encoding Tried to create my own compression<02:52:04.640><c>

if</c><02:53:18.319><c> the</c> down W for 150 milliseconds if the down W for 150 milliseconds if the majority<02:53:18.880><c> of</c><02:53:19.120><c> people</c><02:53:19.359><c> during</c><02:53:19.680><c> that</c><02:53:19.840><c> time</c> majority of people during that time majority of people during that time period<02:53:20.720><c> said</c><02:53:21.040><c> W</c><02:53:21.600><c> Nice</c><02:53:22.399><c> Okay</c><02:53:22.720><c> So</c><02:53:22.880><c> and</c><02:53:23.359><c> how</c><02:53:23.520><c> are</c> period said W Nice Okay So and how are period said W Nice Okay So and how are they<02:53:23.920><c> getting</c><02:53:24.160><c> the</c><02:53:24.399><c> input</c><02:53:24.800><c> of</c><02:53:25.040><c> where</c><02:53:25.279><c> you</c><02:53:25.520><c> are</c> they getting the input of where you are they getting the input of where you are on<02:53:25.840><c> screen</c><02:53:26.479><c> so</c><02:53:26.880><c> and</c><02:53:27.040><c> originally</c><02:53:27.520><c> I</c><02:53:27.840><c> was</c><02:53:28.000><c> going</c> on screen so and originally I was going on screen so and originally I was going to<02:53:28.160><c> send</c><02:53:28.319><c> that</c><02:53:28.479><c> through</c><02:53:28.640><c> Twitch</c><02:53:28.960><c> but</c><02:53:29.200><c> Twitch</c> to send that through Twitch but Twitch to send that through Twitch but Twitch is<02:53:29.680><c> like</c><02:53:29.840><c> 5</c><02:53:30.080><c> seconds</c><02:53:30.399><c> behind</c><02:53:30.960><c> So</c><02:53:31.120><c> that's</c><02:53:31.279><c> why</c><02:53:31.359><c> I</c> is like 5 seconds behind So that's why I is like 5 seconds behind So that's why I piped<02:53:31.840><c> it</c><02:53:32.000><c> out</c><02:53:32.080><c> to</c><02:53:32.240><c> a</c><02:53:32.399><c> website</c><02:53:33.040><c> Nice</c><02:53:33.760><c> So</c> piped it out to a website Nice So piped it out to a website Nice So everybody<02:53:34.240><c> could</c><02:53:34.399><c> see</c><02:53:34.640><c> from</c><02:53:34.880><c> my</c><02:53:35.120><c> computer</c><02:53:35.439><c> to</c> everybody could see from my computer to everybody could see from my computer to the<02:53:35.920><c> website</c><02:53:36.640><c> And</c><02:53:36.880><c> typical</c><02:53:37.520><c> uh</c><02:53:37.760><c> lag</c><02:53:38.080><c> was</c><02:53:38.240><c> right</c> the website And typical uh lag was right the website And typical uh lag was right around<02:53:38.720><c> 70</c><02:53:38.960><c> milliseconds</c><02:53:39.520><c> Mhm</c><02:53:39.920><c> So</c><02:53:40.080><c> it's</c><02:53:40.319><c> like</c> around 70 milliseconds Mhm So it's like around 70 milliseconds Mhm So it's like they<02:53:40.640><c> could</c><02:53:40.800><c> mostly</c><02:53:41.200><c> see</c><02:53:41.439><c> what</c><02:53:41.680><c> was</c><02:53:41.840><c> happening</c> they could mostly see what was happening they could mostly see what was happening in<02:53:42.880><c> that</c><02:53:43.040><c> short</c><02:53:43.279><c> period</c><02:53:43.439><c> of</c><02:53:43.600><c> time</c><02:53:43.840><c> It</c><02:53:44.080><c> was</c><02:53:44.240><c> it</c> in that short period of time It was it in that short period of time It was it was<02:53:44.560><c> pretty</c><02:53:44.800><c> exciting</c><02:53:45.200><c> So</c><02:53:45.359><c> we</c><02:53:45.520><c> had</c><02:53:45.600><c> 1,000</c> was pretty exciting So we had 1,000 was pretty exciting So we had 1,000 people<02:53:46.399><c> or</c><02:53:46.800><c> I</c><02:53:47.040><c> had</c><02:53:47.439><c> somewhere</c><02:53:47.760><c> between</c><02:53:48.000><c> 1,000</c> people or I had somewhere between 1,000 people or I had somewhere between 1,000 to,400<02:53:49.040><c> people</c><02:53:49.840><c> smashing</c><02:53:50.399><c> W's</c><02:53:50.800><c> and</c><02:53:50.960><c> pressing</c> to,400 people smashing W's and pressing to,400 people smashing W's and pressing F<02:53:51.439><c> to</c><02:53:51.680><c> fire</c><02:53:52.000><c> and</c><02:53:52.319><c> turning</c><02:53:52.640><c> and</c><02:53:52.800><c> we</c><02:53:52.960><c> killed</c><02:53:53.200><c> some</c> F to fire and turning and we killed some F to fire and turning and we killed some zombies<02:53:54.319><c> We</c><02:53:54.479><c> blew</c><02:53:54.640><c> up</c><02:53:54.800><c> the</c><02:53:54.960><c> barrel</c><02:53:55.200><c> at</c><02:53:55.439><c> the</c> zombies We blew up the barrel at the zombies We blew up the barrel at the very<02:53:55.680><c> end</c><02:53:55.760><c> of</c><02:53:55.920><c> level</c><02:53:56.160><c> one</c><02:53:56.319><c> to</c><02:53:56.479><c> kill</c><02:53:56.560><c> the</c><02:53:56.720><c> imp</c> very end of level one to kill the imp very end of level one to kill the imp How<02:53:57.359><c> are</c><02:53:57.439><c> you</c><02:53:57.520><c> getting</c><02:53:57.680><c> the</c><02:53:57.920><c> W's</c><02:53:58.319><c> from</c><02:53:58.640><c> the</c> How are you getting the W's from the How are you getting the W's from the Twitch<02:53:59.600><c> chat</c><02:53:59.920><c> is</c><02:54:00.080><c> there</c><02:54:00.240><c> an</c><02:54:00.399><c> API</c><02:54:01.200><c> irc</c><02:54:01.600><c> I</c><02:54:01.760><c> was</c> Twitch chat is there an API irc I was Twitch chat is there an API irc I was using<02:54:02.000><c> IRC</c><02:54:02.560><c> So</c><02:54:02.720><c> just</c><02:54:03.040><c> a</c><02:54:03.279><c> little</c><02:54:03.439><c> TCP</c><02:54:03.920><c> socket</c> using IRC So just a little TCP socket using IRC So just a little TCP socket and<02:54:04.399><c> then</c><02:54:04.479><c> you</c><02:54:04.640><c> just</c><02:54:04.720><c> parse</c><02:54:04.960><c> out</c><02:54:05.200><c> IRC</c><02:54:06.160><c> Okay</c><02:54:06.399><c> And</c> and then you just parse out IRC Okay And and then you just parse out IRC Okay And there's<02:54:06.960><c> very</c><02:54:07.279><c> little</c><02:54:07.439><c> lag</c><02:54:07.760><c> there</c><02:54:08.080><c> Okay</c><02:54:08.640><c> Yeah</c> there's very little lag there Okay Yeah there's very little lag there Okay Yeah I<02:54:09.040><c>

this</c><03:06:15.520><c> idea</c> asserts Yes You talked about this idea asserts Yes You talked about this idea of<03:06:15.840><c> putting</c><03:06:16.000><c> asserts</c><03:06:16.479><c> everywhere</c><03:06:16.960><c> that</c> of putting asserts everywhere that of putting asserts everywhere that effectively<03:06:17.840><c> crash</c><03:06:18.160><c> the</c><03:06:18.520><c> program</c><03:06:19.520><c> when</c><03:06:19.840><c> you</c> effectively crash the program when you effectively crash the program when you you<03:06:20.880><c> have</c><03:06:21.840><c>

before and I know this<03:06:29.040><c> is</c><03:06:29.120><c> like</c><03:06:29.279><c> an</c><03:06:29.439><c> old</c><03:06:29.680><c> technique</c><03:06:30.080><c> and</c><03:06:30.319><c> I</c> this is like an old technique and I this is like an old technique and I obviously<03:06:31.120><c> must</c><03:06:31.359><c> be</c><03:06:31.760><c> too</c><03:06:32.080><c> young</c><03:06:32.160><c>

that</c><03:06:33.200><c> this</c><03:06:33.359><c> was</c><03:06:33.439><c> a</c><03:06:33.600><c> thing</c><03:06:33.760><c> people</c><03:06:33.920><c> did</c> to know that this was a thing people

I</c><03:06:35.200><c> think</c><03:06:35.279><c> that's</c> I grew up in Java and I think that's I grew up in Java and I think that's probably<03:06:35.920><c> why</c><03:06:36.319><c> I</c><03:06:36.560><c> didn't</c><03:06:36.800><c> run</c><03:06:36.960><c> into</c><03:06:37.200><c> this</c><03:06:38.160><c> So</c><03:06:38.720><c> I</c> probably why I didn't run into this So I probably why I didn't run into this So I saw<03:06:39.120><c> that</c><03:06:39.279><c> I</c><03:06:39.359><c> was</c><03:06:39.439><c> like</c><03:06:39.600><c> I'm</c><03:06:39.760><c> curious</c><03:06:40.000><c> about</c> saw that I was like I'm curious about saw that I was like I'm curious about how<03:06:40.319><c> to</c><03:06:40.479><c> use</c><03:06:40.640><c> asserts</c><03:06:41.120><c> more</c><03:06:41.439><c> And</c><03:06:41.600><c> then</c><03:06:41.760><c> I</c><03:06:41.920><c> ran</c> how to use asserts more And then I ran how to use asserts more And then I ran into<03:06:42.240><c> a</c><03:06:42.399><c> person</c><03:06:42.560><c> named</c><03:06:42.800><c> Yuron</c><03:06:43.359><c> He's</c><03:06:43.520><c> the</c><03:06:43.680><c> CEO</c>

what</c><03:06:54.479><c> they</c><03:06:54.640><c> do</c><03:06:54.720><c> is</c><03:06:54.880><c> they</c><03:06:55.040><c> do</c> in Zigg And what they do is they do in Zigg And what they do is they do deterministic<03:06:56.240><c> simulation</c><03:06:56.880><c> testing</c><03:06:57.760><c> and</c> deterministic simulation testing and deterministic simulation testing and they<03:06:58.240><c> just</c><03:06:59.200><c> uh</c><03:06:59.439><c> use</c><03:06:59.840><c> NASA's</c><03:07:00.720><c> kind</c><03:07:00.880><c> of</c> they just uh use NASA's kind of they just uh use NASA's kind of guarantee<03:07:01.520><c> for</c><03:07:01.760><c> creating</c><03:07:02.080><c> really</c><03:07:02.319><c> great</c> guarantee for creating really great guarantee for creating

kind</c><03:07:07.680><c> of</c><03:07:07.840><c> like</c><03:07:08.240><c> things</c> everywhere All these kind of like things everywhere All these kind of like things they<03:07:08.720><c> do</c><03:07:08.880><c> to</c><03:07:09.120><c> be</c><03:07:09.279><c> very</c><03:07:10.000><c> uh</c><03:07:10.160><c> specific</c><03:07:10.640><c> and</c><03:07:10.800><c> one</c> they do to be

function</c><03:07:12.319><c> should</c> of them is that every function should of them is that every function should contain<03:07:13.359><c> two</c><03:07:14.080><c> asserts</c><03:07:15.040><c> whether</c><03:07:15.359><c> it's</c> contain two asserts whether it's contain two asserts whether it's positive<03:07:16.240><c> space</c><03:07:16.560><c> like</c><03:07:17.439><c> uh</c><03:07:17.680><c> you</c><03:07:17.840><c> know</c><03:07:18.080><c> these</c> positive space like uh you know these positive space like uh you know these things<03:07:18.560><c>

Normally</c> things that should never happen Normally things that should never happen Normally you<03:07:26.319><c> just</c><03:07:26.479><c> never</c><03:07:26.640><c> specify</c><03:07:27.040><c>

And</c><03:07:31.439><c> these</c><03:07:31.600><c> asserts</c><03:07:32.080><c> run</c><03:07:32.240><c> both</c><03:07:32.479><c> in</c> asserts And these asserts run both in asserts And these asserts run both in production<03:07:33.279><c> and</c><03:07:33.600><c> in</c><03:07:33.840><c> testing</c><03:07:34.560><c> They're</c><03:07:34.880><c> always</c> production and in testing They're always production and in testing They're always on<03:07:35.760><c> And</c><03:07:35.920><c> then</c><03:07:36.080><c> they</c><03:07:36.560><c> take</c><03:07:36.880><c> determination</c> on And then they take determination on And then they take determination simulation<03:07:38.080><c> test</c><03:07:38.399><c> deterministic</c><03:07:39.040><c> simulation</c> simulation test deterministic simulation simulation test deterministic simulation testing<03:07:40.680><c> and</c><03:07:41.680><c> run</c><03:07:41.920><c> like</c><03:07:42.240><c> 200</c><03:07:42.720><c> years</c><03:07:43.040><c> of</c><03:07:43.279><c> just</c> testing and run like 200 years of just testing and run like 200 years of just random<03:07:43.840><c> data</c><03:07:44.160><c> just</c><03:07:44.399><c> complete</c><03:07:44.800><c> slop</c><03:07:45.120><c> going</c> random data just complete slop going random data just complete slop going through<03:07:45.520><c>

And</c><03:08:06.080><c> I</c><03:08:06.240><c> did</c> like okay I want to try this And I did like okay I want to try this And I did try<03:08:06.479><c> it</c><03:08:06.640><c> I</c><03:08:06.800><c> built</c><03:08:07.200><c> uh</c><03:08:07.359><c> kind</c><03:08:07.520><c> of</c><03:08:07.600><c> like</c><03:08:07.760><c> this</c><03:08:08.000><c> big</c> try it I built

ham<03:08:12.800><c> on</c><03:08:13.040><c> the</c><03:08:13.200><c> asserts</c><03:08:14.080><c> And</c><03:08:14.160><c> then</c><03:08:14.319><c> I</c><03:08:14.479><c> built</c><03:08:14.720><c> a</c> ham on the asserts And then I built a ham on the asserts And then I built a whole<03:08:15.040><c> simulation</c><03:08:15.520><c> testing</c><03:08:15.840><c> thing</c><03:08:16.000><c> that</c> whole simulation testing thing that whole simulation testing thing that could<03:08:16.319><c> do</c><03:08:16.479><c> everything</c><03:08:16.640><c> deterministically</c><03:08:17.600><c>

That's<03:14:53.920><c> not</c><03:14:54.080><c> the</c><03:14:54.239><c> point</c><03:14:54.399><c> of</c><03:14:54.560><c> it</c><03:14:54.800><c> It's</c><03:14:54.960><c> that</c><03:14:55.120><c>

kind</c><03:14:57.279><c> of</c><03:14:57.359><c> like</c><03:14:57.520><c> one</c><03:14:57.680><c> thing</c><03:14:57.760><c> I</c><03:14:58.000><c> think</c> that's kind of like one thing I think that's kind of like one thing I think just<03:14:58.560><c> generally</c><03:14:59.040><c> helps</c><03:14:59.439><c> and</c><03:14:59.600><c> it</c><03:15:00.080><c> ADHD</c><03:15:00.720><c> no</c><03:15:00.920><c> ADHD</c> just generally helps and it ADHD no ADHD just generally helps and it ADHD no ADHD you<03:15:02.080><c> know</c><03:15:02.399><c> the</c><03:15:03.040><c> resilience</c><03:15:03.760><c> emotional</c> you know the resilience emotional you know the resilience emotional resilience<03:15:04.960><c> is</c><03:15:05.200><c> just</c><03:15:05.359><c> like</c><03:15:05.520><c> a</c><03:15:05.760><c> really</c> resilience is just like a really resilience is just like a really important<03:15:06.399><c> aspect</c><03:15:06.800><c> that</c><03:15:07.120><c> just</c><03:15:07.359><c> helps</c><03:15:07.840><c> And</c><03:15:07.920><c> so</c> important aspect that just helps And so important aspect that just helps And so I<03:15:08.239><c> think</c><03:15:08.319><c> that</c><03:15:08.560><c> has</c><03:15:08.720><c> been</c><03:15:08.880><c> a</c><03:15:09.120><c> large</c><03:15:09.359><c> part</c><03:15:09.520><c> that</c> I think that has been a large part that I think that has been a large part that really<03:15:10.000><c> helps</c><03:15:10.319><c> me</c><03:15:10.720><c> Um</c><03:15:11.040><c> there's</c><03:15:11.279><c> things</c><03:15:11.439><c> that</c><03:15:11.600><c> I</c> really helps me Um there's things that I really helps me Um there's things that I still<03:15:12.200><c> obviously</c><03:15:13.200><c> struggle</c><03:15:13.600><c> with</c><03:15:13.920><c> Like</c><03:15:14.800><c> it's</c> still obviously struggle with Like it's still obviously struggle with Like it's clear<03:15:16.080><c> where</c><03:15:16.399><c> I'm</c><03:15:16.800><c> really</c><03:15:17.120><c> bad</c><03:15:17.439><c> at</c><03:15:17.760><c> stuff</c> and<03:15:23.200><c> just</c><03:15:23.520><c> trying</c><03:15:23.760><c> to</c><03:15:23.920><c> like</c><03:15:24.160><c> think</c><03:15:24.399><c> through</c> and just trying to like think through and just trying to like think through all<03:15:24.880><c> the</c><03:15:25.120><c> different</c><03:15:25.359><c> things</c><03:15:25.960><c> that</c><03:15:26.960><c> I'm</c><03:15:27.200><c> bad</c><03:15:27.359><c> at</c> all the different things that I'm bad at all the different things that I'm bad at there's<03:15:27.840><c> more</c><03:15:28.000><c> things</c><03:15:28.080><c> I'm</c><03:15:28.239><c> bad</c><03:15:28.399><c> at</c><03:15:28.560><c> than</c><03:15:28.640><c> I'm</c> there's more things I'm bad at than I'm there's more things I'm bad at than I'm good<03:15:28.960><c> at</c><03:15:29.359><c> And</c><03:15:29.600><c> so</c><03:15:29.760><c> programming</c><03:15:30.319><c> obviously</c><03:15:30.720><c> has</c> good at And so programming obviously has good at And so programming obviously has something<03:15:31.200><c> that</c><03:15:31.600><c> just</c><03:15:31.840><c> allows</c><03:15:32.239><c> me</c><03:15:32.399><c> to</c><03:15:32.560><c> remain</c> something that just allows me to remain something that just allows me to remain focused<03:15:33.279><c> and</c><03:15:33.520><c> it's</c><03:15:33.680><c> like</c><03:15:33.840><c> a</c><03:15:34.080><c> strength</c><03:15:34.399><c> of</c><03:15:34.560><c> mine</c> focused and it's like a strength of mine focused and it's like a strength of mine And<03:15:35.520><c> so</c><03:15:36.399><c> I</c><03:15:36.560><c> started</c><03:15:36.800><c> off</c><03:15:36.960><c> where</c><03:15:37.120><c> I</c><03:15:37.200><c> could</c><03:15:37.279><c> just</c> And so I started off where I could just And so I started off where I could just do<03:15:37.520><c> it</c><03:15:37.600><c> for</c><03:15:37.760><c> a</c><03:15:37.920><c> little</c><03:15:38.000><c> bit</c><03:15:38.399><c> And</c><03:15:38.560><c> then</c><03:15:38.720><c> just</c> do it for a little bit And then just do it for a little bit And then just through<03:15:39.120><c> kind</c><03:15:39.279><c> of</c><03:15:39.359><c> that</c><03:15:39.600><c> emotional</c> through kind of that emotional through kind of that emotional resilience<03:15:40.399><c> I</c><03:15:40.560><c> was</c><03:15:40.640><c> able</c><03:15:40.800><c> to</c><03:15:40.880><c> start</c><03:15:41.040><c> doing</c><03:15:41.120><c> it</c> resilience I was able to start doing it resilience I was able to start doing it more<03:15:41.359><c> and</c><03:15:41.520><c> more</c><03:15:41.680><c> And</c><03:15:41.760><c> so</c><03:15:41.920><c> now</c><03:15:42.080><c> I</c><03:15:42.160><c> can</c><03:15:42.239><c> just</c><03:15:42.399><c> do</c> more and more And so now I can just do more and more And so now I can just do it<03:15:42.560><c> for</c><03:15:42.720><c> like</c><03:15:42.880><c> 10</c><03:15:43.600><c> 12</c><03:15:44.000><c> 15</c><03:15:44.319><c> hours</c><03:15:44.560><c> at</c><03:15:44.720><c> a</c><03:15:44.960><c> time</c><03:15:45.920><c> And</c> it for like 10 12 15 hours at a time And it for like 10 12 15 hours at a time And I<03:15:46.239><c> absolutely</c><03:15:46.640><c> love</c><03:15:46.800><c> it</c><03:15:46.960><c> And</c><03:15:47.120><c> so</c><03:15:47.200><c> it's</c><03:15:47.359><c> it's</c> I absolutely love it And so it's it's I absolutely love it And so it's it's become<03:15:48.160><c> kind</c><03:15:48.319><c> of</c><03:15:48.399><c> like</c><03:15:48.560><c> a</c><03:15:48.720><c> joy</c><03:15:49.040><c> It's</c><03:15:49.200><c> like</c> become kind of

temporary buffer I think uh projectile is<03:30:19.840><c> potentially</c><03:30:20.479><c> close</c><03:30:20.640><c> to</c><03:30:20.880><c> this</c><03:30:21.040><c> in</c><03:30:21.279><c>

I</c><03:30:23.040><c> think</c> can't remember Projectile I think can't remember Projectile I think projectile<03:30:23.600><c> is</c><03:30:23.840><c> closer</c><03:30:24.160><c> to</c><03:30:24.560><c> uh</c><03:30:24.960><c> my</c> projectile is closer to uh my projectile is closer to uh my sessionizing<03:30:25.840><c> script</c><03:30:26.319><c> Anyways</c><03:30:27.120><c> uh</c><03:30:27.359><c> so</c><03:30:27.760><c> now</c><03:30:27.920><c> I</c> sessionizing script Anyways uh so now I sessionizing script Anyways uh so now I can<03:30:28.239><c> I</c><03:30:28.560><c> have</c><03:30:28.720><c> four</c><03:30:29.600><c> pinned</c><03:30:30.000><c> files</c><03:30:30.239><c> in</c><03:30:30.479><c> which</c><03:30:30.640><c> I</c> can I have four pinned files in which I can I have four pinned files in which I can<03:30:30.880><c> go</c><03:30:31.040><c> to</c><03:30:31.200><c> any</c><03:30:31.359><c> of</c><03:30:31.520><c> those</c><03:30:31.680><c> pinned</c><03:30:32.000><c> files</c><03:30:32.160><c> with</c> can go to any of those pinned files with can go to any of those pinned files with just<03:30:32.479><c> a</c><03:30:32.720><c> single</c><03:30:32.880><c> keystroke</c><03:30:33.840><c> And</c><03:30:34.080><c> so</c><03:30:34.239><c> now</c><03:30:34.399><c> it's</c> just a single keystroke And so now it's just a single keystroke And so now it's just<03:30:34.800><c> like</c><03:30:35.359><c> because</c><03:30:35.680><c> every</c><03:30:35.840><c> time</c><03:30:36.000><c> you</c><03:30:36.160><c> develop</c> just like because every time you develop just like because every time you develop a<03:30:36.560><c> feature</c><03:30:36.880><c> usually</c><03:30:37.120><c> you</c><03:30:37.200><c> have</c><03:30:37.359><c> like</c><03:30:37.520><c> three</c> a feature usually you have like three a feature usually you have like three files<03:30:38.000><c> you're</c><03:30:38.319><c> kind</c><03:30:38.399><c> of</c><03:30:38.560><c> primarily</c><03:30:39.040><c> working</c> files you're kind of primarily working files you're kind of primarily working in<03:30:39.600><c> and</c><03:30:39.840><c> I</c><03:30:40.000><c> can</c><03:30:40.080><c> fuzzy</c><03:30:40.479><c> find</c><03:30:40.640><c> for</c><03:30:40.800><c> the</c><03:30:40.960><c> other</c> in and I can fuzzy find for the other in and I can fuzzy find for the other files<03:30:41.760><c> and</c><03:30:42.239><c> that's</c><03:30:42.479><c> that</c><03:30:42.880><c> But</c><03:30:43.120><c> usually</c><03:30:43.439><c> I</c><03:30:43.600><c> just</c> files and that's that But usually I just files and that's that But usually I just have<03:30:43.920><c> like</c><03:30:44.000><c> these</c><03:30:44.239><c> three</c><03:30:44.479><c> power</c><03:30:44.720><c> files</c><03:30:44.960><c> that</c> have like these three power files that have like these three power files that I'm<03:30:45.279><c> always</c><03:30:45.439><c> swapping</c><03:30:45.760><c> in</c><03:30:46.000><c> between</c><03:30:46.479><c> And</c><03:30:46.640><c> so</c> I'm always swapping in between And so I'm always swapping in between And so it's<03:30:46.960><c> like</c><03:30:47.200><c> now</c><03:30:47.600><c> everything</c><03:30:47.920><c> is</c><03:30:48.160><c> just</c><03:30:48.479><c> I</c><03:30:48.640><c> want</c> it's like now everything is just I want it's like now everything is just I want to<03:30:48.800><c> go</c><03:30:48.880><c> to</c><03:30:49.040><c> the</c><03:30:49.120><c> browser</c><03:30:49.439><c> that's</c><03:30:49.680><c> one</c><03:30:49.840><c>

folders</c><03:30:54.640><c> Sometimes</c><03:30:54.960><c> you</c> I need to change folders Sometimes you I need to change folders Sometimes you work<03:30:55.359><c> between</c><03:30:55.600><c> two</c><03:30:55.920><c> different</c><03:30:56.319><c> um</c><03:30:56.800><c> projects</c> work between two different um projects work between two different um projects So<03:30:57.920><c> in</c><03:30:58.160><c> T-Mux</c><03:30:58.960><c> that's</c><03:30:59.359><c> prefix</c><03:31:00.080><c> capital</c><03:31:00.479><c> L</c><03:31:00.720><c> will</c> So in T-Mux that's prefix capital L will So in T-Mux that's prefix capital L will swap<03:31:01.200><c> between</c><03:31:01.359><c> your</c><03:31:01.680><c> last</c><03:31:02.000><c> two</c><03:31:02.399><c> So</c><03:31:02.560><c> I</c><03:31:02.640><c> have</c> swap between your last two So I have swap between your last two So I have alternate<03:31:03.200><c> projects</c><03:31:03.520><c> I</c><03:31:03.680><c> can</c><03:31:03.840><c> even</c><03:31:04.000><c> swap</c> alternate projects I can even swap alternate projects I can even swap between<03:31:04.479><c> projects</c><03:31:04.800><c> in</c><03:31:05.200><c> pretty</c><03:31:05.439><c> much</c><03:31:05.680><c> one</c><03:31:05.920><c> key</c> between projects in pretty much one key between projects in pretty much one key So<03:31:06.560><c> it's</c><03:31:06.720><c> just</c><03:31:06.800><c> like</c><03:31:06.960><c> dude</c><03:31:07.200><c> dude</c><03:31:07.359><c> dude</c><03:31:07.600><c> Just</c> So it's just like dude dude dude Just So it's just like dude dude dude Just trying<03:31:08.000><c> to</c><03:31:08.319><c> optimize</c><03:31:08.880><c> it</c><03:31:09.040><c> so</c><03:31:09.279><c> I</c><03:31:09.520><c> don't</c><03:31:09.680><c> think</c> trying to optimize it so I don't think trying to optimize it so I don't think as<03:31:10.080><c> much</c><03:31:10.239><c> because</c><03:31:10.399><c> I</c><03:31:10.640><c> think</c><03:31:10.800><c> search</c><03:31:11.040><c> fatigue</c> as much because I think search fatigue as much because I think search fatigue is<03:31:12.000><c> a</c><03:31:12.239><c> massive</c><03:31:12.760><c> fail</c><03:31:13.760><c> where</c><03:31:14.000><c> you</c><03:31:14.160><c> have</c><03:31:14.319><c>

fast</c><03:40:57.439><c> So</c><03:40:57.760><c> anyways</c><03:40:58.319><c> very</c><03:40:58.560><c> optimized</c> that as fast So anyways very optimized that as fast So anyways very optimized in<03:40:59.200><c> my</c><03:40:59.279><c> approach</c><03:40:59.600><c> So</c><03:40:59.760><c> I</c><03:41:00.000><c> yank</c><03:41:00.399><c> the</c><03:41:00.560><c> line</c><03:41:00.960><c> paste</c> in my approach So I yank the line paste in my approach So I yank the line paste the<03:41:01.439><c> line</c><03:41:02.000><c> CI</c><03:41:02.479><c> double</c><03:41:02.720><c> quotes</c><03:41:03.040><c> will</c><03:41:03.279><c> delete</c> the line CI double quotes will delete the line CI double quotes will delete everything<03:41:03.840><c> inside</c><03:41:04.239><c> the</c><03:41:04.479><c> first</c><03:41:04.720><c> occurring</c> everything inside the first occurring everything inside the first occurring string<03:41:05.840><c> Then</c><03:41:06.000><c> I</c><03:41:06.160><c> can</c><03:41:06.239><c> type</c><03:41:06.399><c> the</c><03:41:06.640><c> string</c><03:41:07.120><c> escape</c> string Then I can type the string escape string Then I can type the string escape save<03:41:08.080><c> And</c><03:41:08.239><c> so</c><03:41:08.399><c> it's</c><03:41:08.560><c> like</c><03:41:08.720><c> so</c><03:41:09.680><c> optimized</c><03:41:10.160><c> that</c> save And so it's like so optimized that save And so it's like so optimized that I<03:41:10.560><c> can</c><03:41:10.640><c> just</c><03:41:10.880><c> jump</c><03:41:11.200><c>

typically</c><03:57:48.319><c> you'll</c> with alternate file uh typically you'll with alternate file uh typically you'll have<03:57:48.640><c> this</c><03:57:48.800><c> in</c><03:57:49.040><c> all</c><03:57:49.199><c> editors</c><03:57:49.600><c> where</c><03:57:49.920><c> you</c><03:57:50.160><c> can</c> have this in all editors where you can have this in all editors where you can

you</c><03:57:53.520><c> can</c><03:57:53.680><c> have</c><03:57:53.920><c> effectively</c> so that means you can have effectively so that means you can have effectively two<03:57:54.560><c>

that</c><03:58:54.720><c> I</c><03:58:54.880><c> was</c> all over?\" And so I decided that I was all over?\" And so I decided that I was going<03:58:55.120><c> to</c><03:58:55.359><c>

optimized<03:58:57.199><c> to</c><03:58:57.359><c> prevent</c><03:58:57.760><c> the</c><03:58:58.000><c> pain</c><03:58:58.239><c> that</c><03:58:58.399><c> I'm</c> optimized to prevent the pain that I'm optimized to prevent the pain that I'm experiencing<03:58:59.520><c> So</c><03:58:59.760><c> I</c><03:58:59.920><c> used</c><03:59:00.080><c> a</c><03:59:00.239><c> D'voric</c><03:59:00.720><c> as</c><03:59:00.800><c> the</c> experiencing So I used a D'voric as the experiencing So I used a D'voric as the bass<03:59:01.120><c> and</c><03:59:01.359><c> then</c><03:59:01.520><c> laid</c><03:59:01.840><c> out</c><03:59:02.000><c> the</c><03:59:02.160><c> symbols</c><03:59:02.720><c> in</c><03:59:02.960><c> a</c> bass and then laid out the symbols in a bass and then laid out the symbols in a symmetrical<03:59:03.840><c> reasonable</c><03:59:04.399><c> way</c><03:59:05.199><c> so</c><03:59:05.439><c> that</c><03:59:05.600><c> it's</c> symmetrical reasonable way so that it's symmetrical reasonable way so that it's opening<03:59:07.040><c> closing</c><03:59:07.520><c> opening</c><03:59:07.920><c> closing</c><03:59:08.319><c> opening</c> opening closing opening closing opening opening closing opening closing opening closing<03:59:09.120><c> right</c><03:59:09.279><c> and</c><03:59:09.439><c> so</c><03:59:09.600><c> it's</c><03:59:09.760><c> and</c><03:59:10.080><c> they</c><03:59:10.319><c> all</c> closing right and so it's and they all closing right and so it's and they all are<03:59:10.640><c> right</c><03:59:10.800><c> here</c><03:59:11.199><c> I</c><03:59:11.359><c> actually</c><03:59:11.520><c> have</c><03:59:11.680><c> to</c><03:59:11.840><c> hold</c> are right here I actually have to hold are right here I actually have to hold

a number So symbols are shift to press a number So symbols are actually<03:59:15.279><c> my</c><03:59:15.520><c> first</c><03:59:15.680><c> thing</c><03:59:15.840><c> I</c><03:59:16.000><c> get</c><03:59:16.160><c> to</c><03:59:16.319><c> press</c> actually my first thing I get to press actually my first thing I get to press And<03:59:16.880><c> so</c><03:59:17.040><c> it's</c><03:59:17.359><c> very</c><03:59:17.600><c> optimized</c><03:59:18.080><c> for</c><03:59:18.319><c> a</c><03:59:19.279><c> um</c> And so it's very optimized for a um And so it's very optimized for a um laptop<03:59:20.239><c> keyboard</c><03:59:20.800><c> layout</c><03:59:21.359><c> So</c><03:59:21.520><c> I</c><03:59:21.680><c> can</c><03:59:21.760><c> use</c><03:59:21.920><c> my</c> laptop keyboard layout So I can use my laptop keyboard layout So I can use my laptop<03:59:22.399><c> in</c><03:59:22.640><c> a</c><03:59:22.800><c> very</c><03:59:22.960><c> efficient</c><03:59:23.359><c> nice</c><03:59:23.720><c> way</c> laptop in a very efficient nice way laptop in a very efficient nice way That's<03:59:24.960><c> how</c><03:59:25.120><c>

actually falling behind well is anyone actually falling behind for<04:20:58.800><c> not</c><04:20:59.040><c> using</c><04:20:59.520><c> AI</c><04:21:00.000><c> then</c><04:21:00.640><c> because</c><04:21:00.800><c> if</c><04:21:00.960><c> the</c> for not using AI then because if the for not using AI then because if the interface<04:21:01.439><c> is</c><04:21:01.600><c> going</c><04:21:01.680><c> to</c><04:21:01.760><c> change</c><04:21:02.000><c> so</c><04:21:02.239><c> greatly</c> interface is going to change so greatly interface is going to change so greatly that<04:21:02.720><c> all</c><04:21:02.880><c> of</c><04:21:03.040><c> your</c><04:21:03.199><c> habits</c><04:21:03.600><c> need</c><04:21:03.680><c> to</c> that all of your habits need to that all of your habits need to fundamentally<04:21:04.479><c> change</c><04:21:04.960><c> and</c><04:21:05.120><c> it</c><04:21:05.279><c> will</c><04:21:05.439><c> be</c><04:21:05.520><c> able</c>

you're you're over there<04:21:15.680><c> like</c><04:21:15.920><c> actually</c><04:21:16.159><c> doing</c><04:21:16.479><c> punch</c><04:21:16.800><c> card</c><04:21:16.960><c> AI</c> there like actually doing punch card AI there like actually doing punch card AI right<04:21:17.600><c> now</c><04:21:17.920><c> I'm</c><04:21:18.080><c> going</c><04:21:18.159><c> to</c><04:21:18.239><c>

people</c><04:24:03.520><c> should</c><04:24:03.680><c> go</c> one keyboard right uh people should go one keyboard right uh people should go watch<04:24:04.000><c> that</c><04:24:04.239><c> video</c><04:24:04.560><c> where</c><04:24:04.960><c> like</c><04:24:05.279><c> you</c><04:24:05.520><c> guys</c> watch that video where like you guys watch that video where like you guys obviously<04:24:06.319><c> sucked</c><04:24:06.640><c> at</c><04:24:06.880><c> it</c><04:24:07.279><c> Yeah</c><04:24:08.080><c> Co-using</c> obviously sucked at it Yeah Co-using obviously sucked at it Yeah Co-using That<04:24:08.960><c> was</c><04:24:09.120><c> pretty</c><04:24:09.279><c> cool</c><04:24:09.520><c> what</c><04:24:09.680><c> you</c><04:24:09.840><c> guys</c><04:24:10.000><c> did</c> That was pretty cool what you guys did That was pretty cool what you guys did which<04:24:10.479><c> is</c><04:24:10.800><c> controlling</c><04:24:11.760><c> one</c><04:24:12.399><c> new</c><04:24:12.880><c> interface</c> which is controlling one new interface which is controlling one new interface from<04:24:13.840><c> two</c><04:24:14.080><c> different</c><04:24:14.399><c> keyboards</c><04:24:15.120><c> Yeah</c><04:24:15.359><c> And</c> from two different keyboards Yeah And from two different keyboards Yeah And then<04:24:15.680><c> we</c><04:24:15.920><c> each</c><04:24:16.080><c> get</c><04:24:16.239><c> an</c><04:24:16.399><c> allowance</c><04:24:16.720><c> of</c><04:24:16.880><c> certain</c> then we each get an allowance of certain then we each get an allowance of certain characters<04:24:17.520><c> or</c><04:24:17.760><c> motions</c><04:24:18.080><c> we</c><04:24:18.319><c> could</c><04:24:18.479><c> perform</c> characters or motions we could perform characters or motions we could perform Yeah<04:24:19.279><c> And</c><04:24:19.520><c> so</c><04:24:19.680><c> you</c><04:24:20.000><c> both</c><04:24:20.239><c> had</c><04:24:20.479><c> to</c><04:24:20.640><c> like</c> Yeah And so you both had to like Yeah And so you both had to like communicate<04:24:21.279><c> together</c><04:24:21.680><c> That</c><04:24:21.920><c> that's</c><04:24:22.159><c> a</c><04:24:22.319><c> real</c> communicate together That that's a real communicate together That that's a real skill<04:24:22.800><c> I'm</c><04:24:23.040><c> sure</c><04:24:23.120><c> you</c><04:24:23.279><c> can</c><04:24:23.359><c> get</c><04:24:23.600><c> super</c><04:24:23.920><c> like</c> skill I'm sure you can get super like skill I'm sure you can get super like super<04:24:24.800><c> efficient</c><04:24:25.199><c> with</c><04:24:25.520><c> that</c><04:24:26.159><c> But</c><04:24:26.319><c> it</c><04:24:26.399><c> takes</c> super efficient with that But it takes super efficient with that But it takes it<04:24:27.040><c> just</c><04:24:27.199><c> takes</c><04:24:27.600><c> time</c><04:24:27.840><c> to</c><04:24:28.080><c> learn</c><04:24:28.239><c> that</c><04:24:28.479><c> kind</c><04:24:28.560><c> of</c> it just takes time to learn that kind of it just takes time to learn that kind of thing<04:24:28.960><c> So</c><04:24:29.199><c> yeah</c><04:24:29.680><c> I</c><04:24:29.920><c> think</c><04:24:30.319><c> uh</c><04:24:30.399><c> there's</c><04:24:30.720><c> some</c> thing So yeah I think uh there's some thing So yeah I think uh there's some value<04:24:31.120><c> to</c><04:24:31.199><c> it</c><04:24:31.439><c> But</c><04:24:31.600><c> I</c><04:24:31.680><c> I</c><04:24:32.000><c> think</c><04:24:32.080><c> there's</c><04:24:32.319><c> a</c> value to it But I I think there's a value to it But I I think there's a learning<04:24:32.720><c> curve</c><04:24:33.520><c> So</c><04:24:33.680><c> I</c><04:24:33.920><c> have</c><04:24:34.640><c> So</c><04:24:34.880><c> I</c><04:24:35.840><c> I</c><04:24:36.159><c> wanted</c><04:24:36.399><c> I</c> learning curve So I have So I I wanted I learning curve So I have So I I wanted I do<04:24:36.800><c> want</c><04:24:37.040><c> one</c><04:24:37.199><c> thing</c><04:24:37.359><c> to</c><04:24:37.520><c> be</c><04:24:37.600><c> pretty</c><04:24:37.760><c> clear</c><04:24:37.920><c> is</c> do want one thing to be pretty clear is do want one thing to be pretty clear is that<04:24:38.319><c> I</c><04:24:38.479><c> actually</c><04:24:38.640><c> use</c><04:24:38.800><c> AI</c><04:24:39.199><c> quite</c><04:24:39.359><c> a</c><04:24:39.520><c> bit</c><04:24:39.840><c> I</c> that I actually use AI quite a bit I that I actually use AI quite a bit I just<04:24:40.159><c> don't</c><04:24:40.319><c> use</c><04:24:40.399><c> it</c><04:24:40.560><c> for</c><04:24:40.800><c> programming</c><04:24:41.359><c> And</c><04:24:41.520><c> so</c> just don't use it for programming And so just don't use it for programming And so one<04:24:41.840><c> thing</c><04:24:41.920><c> I've</c><04:24:42.159><c> been</c><04:24:42.239><c> trying</c><04:24:42.319><c> to</c><04:24:42.399><c> get</c><04:24:42.720><c> to</c><04:24:42.960><c> is</c> one thing I've been trying to get to is

apps</c><04:35:50.000><c> from</c><04:35:50.160><c> backend</c> just straight up CRUD apps from backend just straight up CRUD apps from backend to<04:35:50.719><c> front</c><04:35:50.879><c> end</c><04:35:51.039><c> and</c><04:35:51.279><c> like</c><04:35:51.520><c> simple</c><04:35:51.920><c> table</c> to front end and like simple table to front end and like simple table displays<04:35:52.799><c> like</c><04:35:53.279><c> yeah</c><04:35:53.680><c> maybe</c><04:35:53.920><c> we</c><04:35:54.160><c> just</c> displays like yeah maybe we just displays like yeah maybe we just couldn't<04:35:54.719><c> quite</c><04:35:55.039><c> automate</c><04:35:55.439><c> that</c><04:35:55.680><c> away</c><04:35:56.639><c> And</c> couldn't quite automate that away And couldn't quite automate that away And now<04:35:57.680><c> we</c><04:35:57.920><c> just</c><04:35:58.080><c> have</c><04:35:58.240><c> something</c><04:35:58.400><c> that</c><04:35:58.639><c> can</c><04:35:58.799><c> just</c> now we just have something that can just now we just have something that can just do<04:35:59.039><c> that</c><04:35:59.199><c> a</c><04:35:59.439><c> little</c><04:35:59.520><c> bit</c><04:35:59.600><c> better</c><04:35:59.840><c> So</c><04:36:00.080><c> now</c> do that a little bit better So now do that a little bit better So now that's<04:36:00.400><c> automated</c><04:36:00.959><c> away</c><04:36:01.600><c> But</c><04:36:01.760><c> that's</c><04:36:02.000><c> not</c> that's automated away But that's not that's automated away But that's not really<04:36:02.480><c> programming</c><04:36:03.119><c> That's</c><04:36:03.680><c> almost</c><04:36:04.000><c> like</c> really programming That's almost like really programming That's

to</c> which is why I'm kind of excited to which is why I'm kind of excited to watch<04:37:06.719><c> you</c><04:37:07.199><c> keep</c><04:37:07.520><c> trying</c><04:37:07.920><c>

like<04:37:09.600><c> we</c><04:37:09.760><c> don't</c><04:37:09.920><c> know</c><04:37:10.080><c> how</c><04:37:10.240><c> it</c><04:37:10.561><c> fits</c><04:37:11.480><c> exactly</c> like we don't

should</c><04:37:15.199><c> be</c><04:37:15.359><c> a</c><04:37:15.520><c> boost</c> but it feels like AI should be a boost but it feels like AI should be a boost to to to

I definitely think it's<04:37:19.920><c> a</c><04:37:20.080><c> boost</c><04:37:20.320><c> to</c><04:37:20.561><c> just</c><04:37:20.799><c> the</c><04:37:20.959><c> joy</c><04:37:21.199><c> of</c> it's a boost to just the joy of it's a boost to just the joy of programming<04:37:22.719><c> I</c><04:37:22.959><c> think</c><04:37:23.039><c> there's</c><04:37:23.279><c> a</c><04:37:23.520><c>

about</c><04:38:41.760><c> it</c><04:38:42.561><c> I</c> actually care about it I actually care about it I mean<04:38:44.320><c> there's</c><04:38:44.639><c> so</c> mean there's so mean there's so many<04:38:46.400><c> aspects</c><04:38:46.879><c> to</c><04:38:47.199><c> caring</c><04:38:48.080><c> but</c><04:38:48.320><c> sort</c><04:38:48.480><c> of</c><04:38:48.561><c> the</c> many aspects to caring but sort of the many aspects to caring but sort of the trivial<04:38:49.279><c> version</c><04:38:49.520><c> of</c><04:38:49.760><c> that</c><04:38:50.000><c> is</c><04:38:50.240><c> a</c><04:38:50.480><c> kind</c><04:38:50.840><c> of</c> trivial version of that is a kind of trivial version of that is a kind of restlessness<04:38:52.561><c> where</c><04:38:52.799><c> you</c><04:38:53.039><c> want</c><04:38:53.119><c> to</c><04:38:53.600><c> keep</c> restlessness where you want to keep restlessness where you want to keep improving<04:38:54.639><c> And</c><04:38:54.799><c> I</c><04:38:54.959><c> think</c><04:38:55.119><c> that</c><04:38:55.520><c> is</c><04:38:55.760><c> very</c><04:38:56.000><c> much</c> improving And I think that is very much improving And I think that is very much AI<04:38:56.719><c> could</c><04:38:56.959><c> do</c><04:38:57.680><c> Yeah</c><04:38:58.000><c> we're</c><04:38:58.320><c> constantly</c><04:38:58.719><c> just</c> AI could do Yeah we're constantly just AI could do Yeah we're constantly just ask<04:38:59.279><c> itself</c><04:38:59.600><c> can</c><04:38:59.760><c> I</c><04:38:59.920><c> make</c><04:39:00.080><c> this</c><04:39:00.359><c> better</c><04:39:01.359><c> and</c><04:39:01.760><c> if</c> ask itself can I make this better and if ask itself can I make this better and if it<04:39:02.240><c> keeps</c><04:39:02.480><c> doing</c><04:39:02.719><c> that</c><04:39:03.439><c> it</c><04:39:03.760><c> probably</c><04:39:04.080><c> is</c><04:39:04.240><c> going</c> it keeps doing that it probably is going it keeps doing that it probably is going to<04:39:04.400><c> take</c><04:39:04.561><c> it</c><04:39:04.719><c> to</c><04:39:04.879><c> some</c><04:39:05.119><c> ridiculous</c><04:39:05.680><c> place</c><04:39:06.240><c> So</c> to take it to some ridiculous place So to take it to some ridiculous place So actually<04:39:06.959><c> it's</c><04:39:07.520><c> it's</c><04:39:07.840><c> also</c><04:39:08.240><c> knowing</c><04:39:09.039><c> when</c><04:39:09.359><c> to</c> actually it's it's also knowing when to actually it's it's also knowing when to stop<04:39:10.320><c> Yeah</c><04:39:11.199><c> Uh</c><04:39:11.520><c> I</c><04:39:11.760><c> think</c><04:39:12.080><c> developing</c><04:39:13.279><c> um</c> stop Yeah Uh I think developing um stop Yeah Uh I think developing um something<04:39:13.920><c> you</c><04:39:14.160><c> can</c><04:39:14.240><c> call</c><04:39:14.840><c> taste</c><04:39:15.840><c> which</c><04:39:16.160><c> is</c> something you can call taste which is something you can call taste which is like<04:39:17.439><c> trying</c><04:39:17.920><c> working</c><04:39:18.320><c> extremely</c><04:39:18.799><c> hard</c> like trying working extremely hard like trying working extremely hard constantly<04:39:19.760><c> improving</c><04:39:20.719><c> until</c><04:39:21.199><c> it</c><04:39:21.439><c> just</c><04:39:21.680><c> feels</c> constantly improving until it just feels constantly improving until it just feels right<04:39:22.400><c> This</c><04:39:22.561><c> is</c><04:39:22.719><c> it</c><04:39:23.359><c> And</c><04:39:23.600><c> I</c><04:39:23.760><c> think</c><04:39:23.920><c> that</c><04:39:24.320><c> is</c><04:39:24.480><c> a</c> right This is it And I think that is a right This is it And I think that is a thing<04:39:24.879><c> that</c><04:39:25.039><c> AI</c><04:39:25.439><c> is</c><04:39:25.600><c> not</c><04:39:25.760><c> good</c><04:39:25.920><c> at</c><04:39:26.080><c> It</c><04:39:26.320><c> was</c><04:39:26.400><c> just</c> thing that AI is not good at It was just thing that AI is not good at It was just like<04:39:27.199><c> yes</c><04:39:27.680><c> this</c><04:39:27.920><c> is</c><04:39:28.000><c> it</c><04:39:28.240><c> Yeah</c><04:39:28.400><c> I've</c><04:39:28.561><c> iterated</c> like yes this is it Yeah I've iterated like yes this is it Yeah I've iterated three<04:39:29.199><c> times</c><04:39:29.359><c> and</c><04:39:29.600><c> three</c><04:39:29.920><c> was</c><04:39:30.160><c> the</c><04:39:30.719><c> that's</c><04:39:30.959><c> it</c> three times and three was the that's it three times and three was the that's it We're<04:39:32.000><c> now</c><04:39:32.240><c> there</c><04:39:32.959><c> And</c><04:39:33.119><c> that</c><04:39:34.400><c> I</c><04:39:34.719><c> think</c> We're now there And that I think We're now there And that I think ultimately<04:39:35.520><c> that</c><04:39:35.760><c>

the</c><04:42:24.160><c> AI</c><04:42:24.638><c> is</c><04:42:25.040><c> really</c><04:42:25.360><c> bad</c> counterintuitive is the AI is really bad counterintuitive is the AI is really bad at<04:42:26.798><c> Yeah</c><04:42:27.200><c> like</c><04:42:27.520><c> that</c><04:42:27.840><c> is</c><04:42:28.000><c> one</c><04:42:28.240><c> of</c><04:42:28.320><c> the</c><04:42:28.480><c>

If</c><04:49:12.480><c> you</c><04:49:12.638><c> say</c><04:49:12.798><c> write</c> programming Sure Yeah If you say write programming Sure Yeah If you say write to<04:49:13.200><c> me</c><04:49:13.440><c> you</c><04:49:13.520><c> know</c><04:49:13.680><c> write</c><04:49:13.840><c> me</c><04:49:14.000><c> quicksort</c><04:49:14.560><c> some</c> to me you know write me quicksort some to me you know write me quicksort some people<04:49:14.878><c> think</c><04:49:15.040><c> quicksort's</c><04:49:15.600><c> super</c><04:49:15.840><c> complex</c> people think quicksort's super complex people think quicksort's super complex Mhm<04:49:17.040><c> But</c><04:49:17.200><c> I</c><04:49:17.360><c> would</c><04:49:17.440><c> argue</c><04:49:17.600><c> that</c><04:49:17.760><c> that's</c> Mhm But I would argue that that's Mhm But I would argue that that's actually<04:49:18.480><c> probably</c><04:49:18.798><c> the</c><04:49:19.040><c> simplest</c><04:49:19.440><c> thing</c><04:49:19.520><c> you</c> actually probably the simplest thing you actually probably the simplest thing you could<04:49:19.840><c> ask</c><04:49:20.000><c> an</c><04:49:20.160><c> AI</c><04:49:20.480><c> to</c><04:49:20.638><c> do</c><04:49:21.120><c> right</c><04:49:21.440><c> things</c><04:49:21.600><c> that</c> could ask an AI to do right things that could ask an AI to do

and so in the same way long hard Road and so in the same way that<00:43:34.599><c> I</c><00:43:34.680><c> think</c><00:43:34.839><c> the</c><00:43:35.079><c> longevity</c><00:43:35.720><c>

dogs</c><00:43:37.319><c> are</c><00:43:37.480><c> going</c><00:43:37.559><c> to</c><00:43:37.720><c> do</c><00:43:37.920><c> well</c> are focused on dogs are going to do well are focused on dogs are

doesn't want their dog like because who doesn't want their dog like to<00:43:40.480><c> live</c><00:43:40.680><c> longer</c><00:43:41.119><c> I</c><00:43:41.200><c> think</c><00:43:41.319><c> that's</c><00:43:41.480><c> like</c><00:43:41.680><c> a</c><00:43:42.280><c> a</c> to live longer I think that's like a a to live longer I think that's like a a problem<00:43:42.800><c> everybody</c><00:43:43.200><c> has</c><00:43:43.640><c> the</c><00:43:43.760><c> background</c><00:43:44.079><c> of</c> problem everybody has the background of problem everybody has the background of that<00:43:44.319><c> is</c><00:43:44.440><c> that</c><00:43:44.559><c> we</c><00:43:44.720><c> had</c><00:43:44.920><c> Kevin</c><00:43:45.119><c> rose</c><00:43:45.400><c> on</c><00:43:45.559><c>

he invested in a longevity<00:43:47.960><c> drug</c><00:43:48.960><c> company</c><00:43:49.559><c> and</c><00:43:49.800><c> their</c><00:43:50.240><c> model</c> longevity drug company and their model longevity drug company and their model their<00:43:51.200><c> their</c><00:43:51.720><c> their</c><00:43:52.440><c> phase</c><00:43:52.720><c> one</c><00:43:52.920><c> was</c><00:43:53.079><c>

that's</c><00:43:54.280><c> an</c><00:43:54.440><c> easy</c><00:43:55.359><c> easier</c> on dogs because that's an easy easier on dogs because that's an easy easier way<00:43:55.800><c> to</c><00:43:55.920><c> get</c><00:43:56.079><c> into</c><00:43:56.319><c> it</c><00:43:56.800><c> he's</c><00:43:57.200><c> way</c><00:43:57.319><c> to</c><00:43:57.400><c> go</c><00:43:57.480><c> to</c> way to get into it he's way to go to way to get into it he's way to go to market<00:43:58.359><c> um</c><00:43:58.640><c> and</c><00:43:58.800><c> and</c><00:43:58.920><c> to</c><00:43:59.079><c> test</c><00:43:59.319><c> your</c><00:43:59.520><c> your</c> market um and and to test your your market um and and to test your your products<00:44:00.400><c> I</c><00:44:00.520><c> think</c><00:44:00.680><c> the</c><00:44:00.880><c> even</c><00:44:01.079><c> easier</c><00:44:01.440><c> version</c> products I think the even easier version products I think the even easier version of<00:44:01.800><c> this</c><00:44:01.920><c> is</c><00:44:02.200><c> plants</c><00:44:03.200><c> and</c><00:44:03.680><c> um</c><00:44:03.880><c> I</c><00:44:03.960><c> know</c><00:44:04.119><c> that</c> of this is plants and um I know that of this is plants and um I know that like<00:44:04.440><c> David</c><00:44:04.640><c> freeberg</c><00:44:05.079><c> is</c><00:44:05.200><c> doing</c><00:44:05.480><c> this</c><00:44:05.720><c> for</c><00:44:06.319><c> a</c> like David freeberg is doing this for a like David freeberg is doing this for a

basically like it's basically<00:44:09.160><c> biohacking</c><00:44:09.920><c> but</c><00:44:10.079><c> for</c><00:44:10.559><c> different</c> basically biohacking but for different basically biohacking but for different crops<00:44:11.440><c> so</c><00:44:11.599><c> how</c><00:44:11.680><c> do</c><00:44:11.800><c> we</c><00:44:11.880><c> make</c><00:44:12.040><c> a</c><00:44:12.160><c>

certain</c><00:44:15.839><c> bugs</c><00:44:16.160><c> or</c><00:44:16.319><c> maybe</c> it's resistant to certain bugs or maybe it's resistant to certain bugs or maybe it<00:44:16.640><c> can</c><00:44:17.160><c> be</c><00:44:17.559><c> riper</c><00:44:18.079><c> maybe</c><00:44:18.240><c> it</c><00:44:18.319><c> can</c><00:44:18.440><c> be</c><00:44:18.559><c> bigger</c> it can be

maybe</c><00:44:20.319><c> it</c><00:44:20.440><c> can</c> maybe it can be juicier maybe it can maybe it can be juicier maybe it can grow<00:44:21.079><c> in</c><00:44:21.200><c> different</c><00:44:21.640><c> different</c><00:44:22.000><c> weather</c> grow in different different weather grow in different different weather conditions<00:44:23.079><c> and</c><00:44:23.280><c> therefore</c><00:44:23.720><c> can</c><00:44:24.559><c> there</c> conditions and therefore can there conditions and therefore can there therefore<00:44:25.760><c> certain</c><00:44:26.200><c> places</c><00:44:26.599><c> can</c><00:44:26.720><c> now</c><00:44:27.079><c> grow</c> therefore certain places can now grow therefore certain places can now grow their<00:44:27.359><c> own</c><00:44:27.520><c> crops</c><00:44:27.760><c> and</c><00:44:27.880><c> don't</c><00:44:28.000><c> have</c><00:44:28.119><c> to</c><00:44:28.240><c> import</c> their own crops and don't have to

you</c><00:44:48.520><c> know</c><00:44:48.839><c> the</c><00:44:48.960><c> little</c> figured out like you know the little figured out like you know the little punet<00:44:49.559><c> square</c><00:44:50.160><c> about</c><00:44:50.720><c> about</c><00:44:50.920><c> how</c><00:44:51.160><c> genetics</c> punet square about about how genetics punet square about about how genetics

I</c><00:44:58.920><c> think</c><00:44:59.119><c> that</c> crossbreeding and so I think that crossbreeding and so I think that there's<00:44:59.440><c> going</c><00:44:59.520><c> to</c><00:44:59.720><c> be</c><00:45:00.319><c> some</c><00:45:00.640><c> really</c> there's going to be some really there's going to be some really successful<00:45:01.720><c>

that take Ai and the concept<00:45:05.319><c> of</c><00:45:05.440><c> biohacking</c><00:45:06.160><c> and</c><00:45:06.280><c> then</c><00:45:06.440><c> use</c> concept of biohacking and then use concept of biohacking and then use plants<00:45:07.520><c> as</c><00:45:07.680><c> their</c><00:45:07.960><c> focus</c><00:45:08.319><c> as</c><00:45:08.440><c> their</c><00:45:08.599><c> target</c> plants as their focus as their target plants as their focus as their target market<00:45:09.319><c> rather</c><00:45:09.559><c> than</c><00:45:09.760><c> humans</c><00:45:10.680><c> what's</c><00:45:11.319><c> uh</c> market rather than humans what's uh market rather than humans what's uh David<00:45:12.079><c> freeberg</c><00:45:13.280><c> thing</c><00:45:14.280><c> it's</c><00:45:14.440><c> called</c> David freeberg thing it's called David freeberg thing it's called AOL<00:45:16.599><c> and</c><00:45:17.119><c> and</c><00:45:17.720><c> uh</c><00:45:17.880><c>

they're basically<00:45:27.119><c> creating</c><00:45:27.520><c> new</c><00:45:27.720><c> seeds</c><00:45:28.119><c> or</c><00:45:28.280><c> new</c> basically creating new seeds or new basically creating new seeds or new style<00:45:28.920><c> plants</c><00:45:29.599><c> yeah</c><00:45:30.599><c> um</c><00:45:30.760><c> I</c><00:45:30.800><c> don't</c><00:45:30.920><c> know</c><00:45:31.079><c> you</c> style plants yeah um I don't know you style plants yeah um I don't know you know<00:45:31.480><c> they</c><00:45:31.559><c> haven't</c><00:45:31.800><c> been</c><00:45:32.079><c> super</c><00:45:33.079><c> like</c> know they haven't been super like know they haven't been super like they're<00:45:33.800><c> not</c><00:45:34.040><c> they're</c><00:45:34.200><c> not</c><00:45:34.319><c> in</c><00:45:34.520><c> stealth</c><00:45:34.880><c> but</c> they're not they're not in stealth but they're not they're not in stealth but they're<00:45:35.160><c> not</c><00:45:35.359><c> like</c><00:45:35.640><c> it's</c><00:45:35.760><c> not</c><00:45:35.920><c> like</c><00:45:36.040><c> super</c> they're not like it's not like super they're not like it's not like super obvious<00:45:36.760><c> exactly</c><00:45:37.000><c> what</c><00:45:37.119><c> they're</c><00:45:37.240><c> doing</c><00:45:37.440><c> but</c> obvious exactly what they're doing but obvious exactly what they're doing but like<00:45:37.680><c> they</c><00:45:37.800><c> have</c><00:45:37.920><c> this</c><00:45:38.000><c> thing</c><00:45:38.160><c> like</c><00:45:38.280><c> boosted</c> like they have this thing like boosted like they have this thing like boosted breeding<00:45:39.000><c> so</c><00:45:39.119><c> it's</c><00:45:39.280><c> basically</c><00:45:39.680><c> like</c><00:45:40.079><c> how</c><00:45:40.200><c> do</c> breeding so it's basically like how do breeding so it's basically like how do you<00:45:40.400><c> get</c><00:45:40.559><c> more</c><00:45:40.880><c> yield</c><00:45:41.839><c> on</c><00:45:42.359><c> uh</c><00:45:42.480><c> on</c><00:45:42.599><c> your</c><00:45:42.800><c> crops</c> you get more yield on uh on your crops you get more yield on uh on your crops right<00:45:43.760><c> or</c><00:45:43.960><c> they'll</c><00:45:44.160><c> have</c><00:45:44.400><c> like</c><00:45:44.559><c> value</c><00:45:44.839><c> added</c> right or they'll have like value added right or they'll have like value added traits<00:45:45.559><c> which</c><00:45:45.680><c> is</c><00:45:45.839><c> like</c><00:45:46.240><c> how</c><00:45:46.359><c> do</c><00:45:46.640><c> you</c><00:45:47.640><c> take</c><00:45:47.839><c> a</c> traits which is like how do you take a traits which is like how do you take a crop<00:45:48.359><c> but</c><00:45:48.520><c> then</c><00:45:48.760><c> add</c><00:45:49.160><c> you</c><00:45:49.280><c> know</c><00:45:49.520><c> a</c><00:45:49.920><c> a</c><00:45:50.079><c> trait</c> crop but then add you know a a trait crop but then add you know a a trait that<00:45:50.680><c> you</c><00:45:50.800><c> want</c><00:45:51.240><c> right</c><00:45:51.400><c> gain</c><00:45:51.599><c> a</c><00:45:51.800><c> function</c><00:45:52.319><c> but</c> that you want right gain a function but that you want right gain a function but not<00:45:52.599><c> for</c><00:45:52.760><c> viruses</c><00:45:53.440><c> but</c><00:45:53.640><c> for</c><00:45:53.920><c> for</c><00:45:54.079><c> your</c><00:45:54.319><c> for</c> not for viruses but for for your for not for viruses but for for your for your<00:45:54.520><c> strawberries</c><00:45:55.000><c> for</c><00:45:55.119><c> your</c><00:45:55.200><c> almonds</c><00:45:55.640><c> for</c> your strawberries for your almonds for your strawberries for your almonds for your<00:45:55.880><c> potatoes</c><00:45:56.319><c> for</c><00:45:56.440><c> your</c><00:45:56.559><c>

coding all right so there's there's a coding all right so there's there's a couple<00:53:52.880><c> of</c><00:53:53.160><c> startups</c><00:53:53.960><c> like</c><00:53:54.960><c> because</c><00:53:55.079><c> of</c><00:53:55.200><c> Peter</c> couple of startups like because of Peter couple of startups like because of Peter levels<00:53:55.920><c> is</c><00:53:56.160><c> how</c><00:53:56.440><c> know</c><00:53:56.599><c> about</c><00:53:56.760><c> it</c><00:53:57.559><c> okay</c><00:53:57.680><c> so</c> levels is how know about it okay so levels is how know about it okay so there's<00:53:57.920><c> a</c><00:53:58.000><c> couple</c><00:53:58.200><c> of</c><00:53:58.280><c> startups</c><00:53:58.680><c> like</c><00:53:58.799><c> cursor</c> there's a couple of startups like cursor there's a couple of startups like cursor which<00:53:59.400><c> is</c><00:53:59.599><c> like</c><00:54:00.119><c> absolutely</c><00:54:00.559><c> blown</c><00:54:00.880><c>

dollar<00:54:04.720><c> company</c><00:54:04.960><c> in</c><00:54:05.040><c> a</c><00:54:05.160><c> very</c><00:54:05.280><c> short</c><00:54:05.559><c> period</c><00:54:05.799><c> of</c> dollar company in a very short period of dollar company in a very short period of time<00:54:06.520><c> cursor</c><00:54:06.920><c> is</c><00:54:07.079><c> basically</c><00:54:07.400><c> like</c><00:54:07.480><c> a</c><00:54:07.599><c> coding</c> time cursor is basically like a coding time cursor is basically like a coding terminal<00:54:08.880><c> but</c><00:54:09.079><c> you</c><00:54:09.200><c> can</c><00:54:09.440><c> but</c><00:54:09.599><c> AI</c><00:54:09.880><c> is</c><00:54:09.960><c> built</c><00:54:10.200><c> in</c> terminal but you can but AI is built in terminal but you can but AI is built in right<00:54:11.000><c> and</c><00:54:11.160><c> so</c><00:54:11.440><c> you</c><00:54:11.520><c> can</c><00:54:11.760><c> code</c><00:54:12.119><c>

like</c><00:15:11.360><c> that</c><00:15:11.519><c> and</c><00:15:11.600><c> it</c><00:15:11.720><c> created</c> China didn't like that and it created China didn't like that and it created what<00:15:12.199><c> was</c><00:15:12.360><c> called</c><00:15:12.519><c> the</c><00:15:12.600><c> first</c><00:15:12.839><c> Opium</c><00:15:13.279><c> War</c><00:15:14.000><c> and</c> what was
